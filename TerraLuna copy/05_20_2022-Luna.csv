The crypto space seems to bring out human cognitive biases and flawed thinking like nothing else! If there's one thing I've learnt about making money in crypto, is that you will NEVER find your edge if you continue believing what the majority of retail money believes :

\-&gt; You've got people WORSHIPPING their cult leaders (aka project founders), following their every word and sniffing their every fart, in the hope that they will one day lead them to the promised Lambo Land, and then being left holding the bags when Project Jesus runs off with their money...

\-&gt; You've got people truly believing that WHALES are going to come in and SAVE THE DAY once they start realising that momentum is picking back up again, while not realising that whales and market makers are the ones who are creating the momentum IN THE FIRST PLACE (when, and only when, their bargain bags have been filled...).

\-&gt; You've got people thinking that macro news is going to make all the difference in price action, not realising that a lot of it has already been priced in by the time they come to learn of it, and that trying to get your alpha from the news is like proposing to a stripper cos she gave you a lap dance (rephrase : you're not that special)... No, ETFs aren't going to make BTC go to 500K, so get that out of your head

\-&gt; AND you've got people STILL buying up LUNA in the hopes of it doing a 1000x in the future... might as well take your money down to the race track and demand that the bookies take your bet on a dead horse...

Many of you are either providing exit liquidity for the big players while being shaken out by bounces and fakeouts, or making fake crypto gurus rich while losing your hard earned cash. It pisses me off... cos you shouldn't be losing your money this way. But I'm not judging... I'm just saying this because I wish somebody had told me all the above when I first got into crypto in 2017. STOP RELYING ON OTHER PEOPLE TO MAKE YOUR DREAM COME TRUE, and go out and take the bull by the horns!

Luckily I've learnt from my mistakes, and I've finally managed to find my edge after years of hard lessons and research, by connecting with and learning from the right people who have the correct software installed in their brain. This means that not only do I get to KEEP THE MONEY THAT I HAVE, but I also MAKE MUCH MORE than I ever thought I could. Yes it is possible... even in a bear market (or as I've now come to realise, ESPECIALLY in a bear market). But it certainly won't happen if you subscribe to any of the fallacies above. And it certainly win't help if you just ape into random coins hoping one of them will do 1000x. You need to get your alpha, your edge same as I did, and same as all the people who I know of that are winning in crypto.

I have ETH, AVAX, SHIB, BTC AND APE in my portfolio currently... With AVAX being my second biggest holding. My question is ... 

Do you think AVAX will survive this bear market?

I did alot of research and I think the tokenomics are great and the project has alot of potential BUT this -80% drop has been hard on the soul. Plus the tie to Terra Luna makes me really nervous.  I know alot of coins die in bear markets and only few survive.

And everyone in this space knows that USDT (Tether) has long been suspected of hiding its true reserves.

This morning, Tether [published a report](https://tether.to/en/assurance-opinion-once-again-re-affirms-tethers-reserves-fully-backed-reveals-significant-reductions-in-commercial-paper-and-increase-in-us-treasury-bills/) signed by an independent firm in which the reserves are estimated at just over 82 billion USD.

One thing I personally find interesting is that Tether seems to be moving away from commercial paper (illiquid debt instruments compared to other financial vehicles) and more towards the rock solid US treasury bills. They claim that commercial papers went down by 17% fro prior quarter. Tether also says that the ratings of the commercial papers they still hold has been upgraded from A-2 to A-1, which theoretically mean that they are less likely to default.

Now, I would not take for granted all this information. Tether has shown some tendency to be somewhat secretive in the past. But given the recent events, I think it's a good thing that they try to be more transparent - and **if the assesment is truthful, then the biggest stablecoin in our ecosystem is safe**, and we don't have to worry about another depeg disaster.

[EXPERIMENT - Tracking Top 10 Cryptos Of 2021 - Month Sixteen – UP +177&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/gzyvmghslf091.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=279162274d11be3909a53358d8dca2eb94a0b3b1)

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.** Below is the month 16update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment.

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, 2021, and again in 2022 because I'm a glutton for punishment and to show different entry points.
* ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* April highlights:  Every crypto in the 2021 Portfolio in the red, **BNB** continues to maintain a strong overall lead, 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +177% in sixteen months 
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +219% compared to +29% in the S&amp;P 500 if invested as per the rules of the Experiments.**

## Month Sixteen – UP 177%

https://preview.redd.it/hpi6ygnsmf091.png?width=1050&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339d8380b301edf7cd806be004d8e44a9e869959

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

April highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* Every crypto in the 2021 Portfolio in the red
* **BNB** continues to maintain a strong overall lead
* 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +177% in sixteen months

## April Ranking and Dropout Report

https://preview.redd.it/11mx1a4umf091.png?width=406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5447262a3c33a6fef7d6650cce55bd2e6760816

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  sixteen months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, four cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot** and **Bitcoin Cash.**  They have been replaced by **SOL**, **Luna, UST,** and **USDC**.

## April Winners and Losers

***April Winners*** –  None, unless you count **USDT**

***April Losers*** –   **LINK** lost more than a third of its value, down -35% in April. **ADA** didn’t fare much better, dropping -32%, the second worst performer this month.

## Overall Update – BNB far head, 70% of cryptos in green, Litecoin at the bottom

As has largely been the case, **BNB** remains the crypto to beat in the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio. It is up +913%, the $100 investment into **BNB** sixteen months ago is now worth **$1,016.**

**Litecoin** is the worst performing of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio cryptos at this point in the Experiment, down **-21%** since [January, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/). 

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/tiz1xcpvmf091.png?width=582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=152fbe4a1941572cd5d057a3edfc8cc26a1983c0

As a sector, crypto is up **+126%** since January 2021.

You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has produced better returns than the overall crypto market cap (+177% vs. +126%) over the sixteen month life of the 2021 Portfolio.

This is a bit of an outlier and the gap is closing fast: the rest of the [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) are well behind over their respective market caps in their respective time frames.  Here are the latest figures:

**Buying the Top Ten at equal weight in Jan 2018:** down -1% vs. +205% for the total crypto market cap. 

**Starting in Jan 2019?** \+368% for the Top Ten vs. +1,277% for the total market cap. 

**Starting in Jan 2020?** \+574% for the Top Ten vs. +824% for the total Market Cap. 

**Starting in Jan 2022?** \-24% for the Top Ten vs. -21% total market cap.  

Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments.

Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +177%.  The initial $1000 investment sixteen months ago, on New Year’s Day, 2021, is worth **$2,771**. 

Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective as we go along:

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the fifth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of the last crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -1% (total value $986)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +368% (total value $4,684)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +574% (total value $6,735) **(best performing portfolio)**
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16): up +177% (total value $2,771)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3): down -24% (total value $762)

So overall? Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After five annual $1k investments ($5,000 total) in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$15,938.**

**That’s up +219%** on the combined portfolios. The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**

To visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/llqexme1nf091.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d379350149aab679d3ddd298eb7c4ea2dcaa2619

In summary: ***That’s a +219% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets:

https://preview.redd.it/235ubup2nf091.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fb028e94735717ff08ccec5e364b634eac4114b

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up **+10%** since January 1st, 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto sixteen months ago would be worth **$1,100** had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+177%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto sixteen months ago is now worth **$2,771.**

That’s a difference of **$1,671** on a $1k investment in sixteen months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first five years of the Top Top Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,550 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,650 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,280 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,100 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $870 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After five $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $6,450.**

That is up **+29%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+219%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

To help provide perspective, here’s a chart showing the combined five year ROI for the Crypto Top Ten Experiment vs. the S&amp;P up to this point:

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride.

Binance's holdings of the coin were once worth $1.6 billion but are now worth about $2,200.

According to Bloomberg estimates, Zhao is still a billionaire and Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange.

Chanpeng Zhao, the wealthy founder of crypto exchange Binance, joked on Tuesday that he was ""poor again"" after the exchange's investments in the luna cryptocurrency crashed from $1.6 billion just a month ago to about $2,200 this week.

In a tweet on Monday, Zhao said that Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, held 15 million luna tokens. Binance received these tokens in exchange for its $3 million investment in 2018 into the Terra network that luna is based on. Its luna tokens were ""never moved or sold"" as of Monday, according to Zhao.

Insider has reached out to Zhao for comment.

Binance's luna holdings were worth $1.6 billion in early April when the token hit its peak price. But its recent crash saw that value shrink to about $2,200 this week. The coin is trading at about $0.0001468 as of Thursday.

Luna's value has rapidly plunged in the past two weeks.

Its implosion started when its sister token, TerraUSD, lost its peg to the US dollar two weeks ago. The two tokens' valuations are tied to each other. When TerraUSD's price fell, investors rushed to dump their holdings of that token in a scenario similar to a bank run. TerraUSD's plunge, in turn, dragged down luna's price.

The two tokens' free fall was estimated to have wiped out more than $50 billion in paper value, Insider reported on Sunday.

Zhao on Monday urged the Terra team to reimburse its retail investors first. ""To lead by example on PROTECTING USERS, Binance will let this go and ask the Terra project team to compensate the retail users first, Binance last, if ever,"" he tweeted.

Despite his comments, Zhao, 45, definitely isn't broke. He has a net worth of about $14.8 billion as of Thursday, based on Bloomberg's estimates. The majority of his wealth likely comes from his estimated 70% stake in Binance, according to Forbes.

Binance's market value is estimated to be six times that of its nearest competitor, Coinbase, Forbes reported in March. Binance took in about $14.6 billion in trading fees last year, according to MarketWatch, which quoted a report published by financial-services consultancy Opimas.

Here are some questions: 

1. Why he promote Luna and what are he and Binance doing to mitigate such risk?
2. What is his personal relationship with USDT and if he or affiliated parties have made redemptions?
3. Is the Binance ""Tai Chi"" document real and if yes; why did you openly attempt to scam the US government and people?
4. Why is BSC a blatant copy of ETH?
5. Why was Binance  promoting zero sum 100x leverage up until FTX started the 20x rule? 
6. Why didn't you comply with EU regulations if ""transparency is key""? 

Ask him that if not why is he even coming to this space?

He is the embodiment of ""The Ghost of Mt.Gox""

He isn't a Dev like Vitalik, Charles or Gavin

He isn't a large investor or financial market maker like Saylor, Wood or hell even Elon

He isn't a pioneer like Adam Back, Nick Szabo or any of the countless "" cryptonauts""

Then I saw that LUNA was collapsing, and collapsing, and collapsing. I heard drums in the distance, along with a crowd chanting ""YOLO!"" There were so many zeroes in that price and I realized that I could net, like, 20k coins.

I did it.

I threw down my entire savings.

Investing in a coin or token is an investment into a team, ecosystem, or a setup. If your buying a coin that financially looks blessing, but the team is dog water you need to evaluate how trustworthy of a proposition the project is offering. Obviously a LUNA inspired post but this goes for everything here. 

It seems a lot of people on this subreddit say ALTs aren't good investments, not like BTC and ETH which are ""the only blue chips"". It's not that the statement beforehand is a lie, it's that multiple projects promise a decentralized approach with way faster and cheaper methods than either of those options. We like them because of first mover advantage and the ecosystems developed around them, not because they are better constructed than other choices. Most of the top 20 coins are solid picks which can be vetted out by looking at the project managers but we pretend everything other than those can't be trusted in any capacity, which is completely unbased for a large portion of the argument (LUNA could have been prevented by a thorough vetting on the whitepaper).

The whole market is down, including BTC and ETH so money is lost either way. If you have a complete shitcoin, you will fail.

 [Why the Crypto Market Crashed: The Attack on UST Stable Coin (venturetime.co)](https://www.venturetime.co/p/why-the-crypto-market-crashed-the?s=w) 

UST from Terra Labs crashed as you know - does anyone see a way for other similar stable coins to avoid attacks while still backing their coin with On-Chain digital assets? I've done some research on the attack on the link attached, curious to hear your thoughts.

Terra was one of the first issuers to back their stable coin, UST, with on-chain digital assets, using their token Luna. It is important to note that Terra also had several billion dollars in Bitcoin collateral on the side. Their stable coin UST was pegged at $1, but in periods of demand for stable coins, the price might rise to $1.01. At this point, investors in Luna can convert their Luna for UST. This increases the supply of UST, which will help bring down the market price back to $1. The investor can then sell the UST at $1.01, making 1% on the transaction. The brilliance of the TerraUST/Luna conversion is that investors are incentivized with an arbitrage opportunity to regulate and maintain the stable coin’s price. In the Terra ecosystem, no issuing body increases or decreases the supply of UST; rather the market does so itself. Investors trust that this self-correcting cycle will hold up their stable coin.

On May 10th, the price of UST fell from $1 to $0.62, a shock to the cryptocurrency community. In the following days, it fell further to less than a cent. For the last six months, crypto lending platform Anchor offered a 20% yield to investors who bought UST and lent it on the Anchor protocol. This move was meant to be a marketing campaign by Terra, hoping to draw in new customers. Such a high return led to countless investors flocking to UST, hoping to be rewarded with such a high yield. This opened the door for a dramatic attack, being likened to George Soros’ attack on the Bank of England.

Terra held several billion dollars worth of Bitcoin in collateral for its UST stable coin. An attacker borrowed $3 billion in Bitcoin and bought about $1 billion in UST. The attacker then started selling the UST very quickly, destabilizing UST and dropping it below the $1 peg. Terra sold more and more Bitcoin as the price of UST dropped, hoping to restabilize the price. However, this caused the Bitcoin market to tank as well, with so many coins entering the market. The attacker then bought back their Bitcoin, essentially “short selling” Bitcoin for a huge profit. As a result of the attacker dumping $1 billion in UST on the open market, other market participants lost faith in the stable coin and their promised 20% yield, causing a massive bank-run on UST, with almost all holders attempting to sell. As a result, the attacking party made off with a huge gain on their short sale of Bitcoin. UST and Luna are now worth practically nothing, as investors lost faith in the tokens.

While on-chain collateral for stable coins was a widely anticipated development for the crypto community, the Terra attack shows two important lessons for investors. First, the attacker relied on the widespread panic and subsequent bank run on UST once its price was low enough that investors lost faith. Stable coins with larger market caps, and therefore larger liquidity pools, are harder to manipulate. While no stable coin issuer can simply increase their market cap at will, investors and issuers alike should see the benefits of more established projects, understanding that smaller cap projects are riskier investments, as they are prone to similar attacks. Second, the irresponsibility of Do Kwan, founder of Terra, is greatly responsible for the bank run that occurred on his token. Kwan, an energetic and eccentric entrepreneur, is also a shady businessman, who began his career with an algorithmic stable coin project named Basis Cash in 2020, which also failed to maintain its $1 peg. Kwan’s 20% yield Anchor marketing campaign was unsustainable from the start and was designed to be a Ponzi scheme. Kwan paid investors their 20% yield with money from new investors, taking advantage of investors for his own company’s gain. The unrealistic expectations of investors led to their exaggerated fear when the coin dropped, causing the bank run and crash of UST. Investors need to be wary of unrealistic returns and conduct research on the individuals they are trusting with their money.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4884608,public,,self,Thoughts on Digital Asset backed Stable coins?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uskk8p/thoughts_on_digital_asset_backed_stable_coins/,,all_ads,6,1652872872.0,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'cP-EcBWy187bbliTzMeyK6nfykydgAyTSf_XqCEDhx4', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b_EMzmzZaSVj7okrlYD8yFnqqjfd7jMBHv9DPYw8Dr4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34937e5e630e3e42da54d7e7a04032e714644e41', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b_EMzmzZaSVj7okrlYD8yFnqqjfd7jMBHv9DPYw8Dr4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d367126dc9aa21c13b335e934923a910c51bfaac', 'width': 216}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b_EMzmzZaSVj7okrlYD8yFnqqjfd7jMBHv9DPYw8Dr4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f293a2d92ce03e09182e6130322b603f442e1203', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 600, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/b_EMzmzZaSVj7okrlYD8yFnqqjfd7jMBHv9DPYw8Dr4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5adbd6b9d2e5a7a510d11e599729405bab8af607', 'width': 600}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,

However, official voting on the proposal has begun today and the validators (who have close ties to Do Kwon, presumably) are voting overwhelmingly in favor of Do Kwon's proposal, against the wishes of the community at large.

If Do Kwon manages to force through his hard fork because of his relationships with the validators that run the governance process, does this reveal a massive fundamental flaw in these smaller POS chains?

Since we have a lot of people here still owning their coins and tokens on an exchange, i want to mention something.

A lot of users lost a lot of money during the crash of UST and LUNA. Why? Because the exchanges took off the traiding pairs with those coins to not loose money by themselve and then a lot of users werent be able to sell before the crash happened.

So please always remember this, not your key not your crypto.
Store them in your wallet!😅 Also diversify yourself as good as possible! There are some stacking pool on DeHive finance where you can splitt up your savings in different stable coins and yield some nice APY with autocompound so you can forget about them for a while a recover your head.

During times like this we need to stay strong and start using dexentralised platform!

BTC has been recently trading at a price over $30,500 with ether up by 3%, CRO, ALGO rose over 3%, and SLC over 1% in the past 24 hours.

Furthermore, the current UST, terraUSD, a decentralized algorithmic stable coin that is supposed to help curb volatility in the crypto market was moving at a $1 peg but now plunged as low as 26 cents. Other popular stable coins like USDT, USDC, and BUSD are causing a crisis due to changes in traders' need for a better stable coin.

So before 8th May I was holding most of my stable coins into ust, I noticed that ust price dropped from 1$ to around .99, i wanted to convert my ust into busd but I was losing like 300-400$ , I didn’t want to lose money on a “stable coin” I thought it’s fine maybe it will go back to $1 but it stayed below $1 for long so I felt things can turn ugly and converted half my ust into usdc and busd , lost few hundreds , then price went down more and I panicked and converted all my ust into other stable coins , I forgot maybe  I ended up losing $2k or something .. which is fine and I lost 2-3k$ trading daily anyways (I’m kinda trading gambler) but inside I was lil mad like why would i lose money on a stable coin even if it’s just 2k$ so I decided to buy ust again at 0.88$ coz I wanna recover that $2k I just earlier that day , I thought if it goes to $0.91 I would be in profit .. then the real downfall started, ust started dropping for real and went down to 0.78, and I sold at this point I’m down like $8k. Now I’m mad coz i wanna recover this shit, bought 1k Luna at around $33 so like 33k worth Luna , price went 35$ I’m up $2k  I’m happy but ofc I didn’t sell maybe going back to 50$ and I will be in profit … few hrs passed Luna went down to 22$ and I sold again .. don’t remember exactly how much I was down at this point , Maybe around 20k but I wasn’t done! I bought Luna again at 5$ and sold way lower .. from around $40k I have $2.5k left then I decided to give up.

I am looking for new investments in this market and have been looking at SNX. 

However, while doing my research I learned that SNX burns and mints tokens based on a collateralisation ratio. This is stated in the Litepaper:

""Minting, burning, and the C-Ratio

The mechanisms above ensure SNX stakers are incentivized to maintain their Collateralisation Ratio (C-Ratio) at the optimal rate (currently 400%). This ensures Synths are backed by sufficient collateral to absorb large price shocks. If the value of SNX or Synths fluctuates, each staker’s C Ratio will fluctuate. If it falls below 400% (although there is a small buffer allowing for minor fluctuations), they will be unable to claim fees until they restore their ratio. They adjust their ratio by either minting Synths if their ratio is above 400%, or burning Synths if their ratio is below 400%.""

This makes me worried that I am at risk of another LUNA situation by investing in this project.

In the following breakdown I will shortly summarize the nature and composition of collateral of the top 10 USD pegged stablecoins by marketcap. Feel free to correct me in case of mistakes.

# Top 10 Stablecoins

1. **USDT (Tether):** the largest stablecoin by marketcap is a centralized asset-backed stablecoin operated and issued by Tether Holdings which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. Tether reports that each coin is backed 1:1 by reserves equivalent to it's value in dollar, the last report of their assets by an independent accountant dates back to **December 31, 2021**. Their own reserves breakdown shows that only **6,36%** of their assets are cash reserves, but supposedly **83,74%** of their assets are held in short-term deposits, cash or equivalents and commercial papers. Interestingly they claim to have **6,38%** of their assets invested into vague ""other investments"" including digital tokens. We don't know if USDT is backed 1:1 and even if the claims about their assets are true the collateral is partly illiquid and a small percentage is even backed-up by risky assets.
2. **USDC(USD Coin):** Another centralized asset-backed stablecoin that is operated and issued by Centre a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase. Circle is in charge of the public operations and like Tether claims that each coin is backed 1:1 by reserves equivalent to it's value in dollar, they are subject to regular audits. The latest attestation conducted by Grant Thornton LLP and denominates all reserves through **March 31, 2022.** They attest that USDC is indeed backed up 1:1 or more. As of **May 13** Circle claims **22,9%** of USDC's collateral is in Cash  and the other **77,1%** in U.S. Treasuries. In conclusion if Circles claims are true USDC is also partly backed-up by illiquid assets. (they might be able to take short-time loans against these assets in case of a bank run since U.S. Treasuries are very safe)
3. **BUSD(Binance USD):** This is a special case that also includes **9. USDP(Paxos Standard)**. Those two coins are centralized asset-backed stablecoins operated by Paxos Trust company, BUSD is issued by Binance and USDP by Paxos themselves. Paxos prides themselves with offering an regulated stablecoin overseen by the NY State Department of financial services. Paxos claims that both stablecoins are fully backed by cash or equivalents. Both coins are subject to monthly audits, the last one was conducted for **April 29, 2022**. The audit attests that both coins are **100%** backed-up by cash and cash equivalents. Thus these coins can be seen as ""true"" stablecoins regarding liquidity. 
4. **DAI:** A decentralized, asset-backed stablecoin that is developed by the MakerDAO project. DAI's are minted when enough collateral is placed into a smart contract on the Ethereum network, which means DAI is created through loans and subsequently burned when these loans are paid back or get liquidated. The composition of collateral is thus [completely transparent at all times](https://makerburn.com/#/rundown). The loan based creation of DAI leads the asset to being heavily overcollateralized being backed up **177%** by various crypto- and a small amount of real world-assets. Nontheless DAI is heavily backed-up by centralized assets like USDC and USDP to remain it's peg which sparks the question if DAI can truly be called decentralized when almost half of it's value comes from cenralized stablecoins. 
5. **MIM(Magic Internet Money):**  is a asset-backed stablecoin minted by the decentralized platform [Abracadabra.money](https://Abracadabra.money). In principle MIM works similar to DAI only MIM's goal is to turn illiquid assets liquid and allows to borrow against previously locked up collateral. This makes MIM more decentralized than DAI as it does not rely on centralized stablecoins to hold it's peg, but it is yet to be seen how the asset will react to a bank run. 
6. **FRAX:** a fractional algorithmic stablecoin developed by frax finance which is registered in the cayman islands. The coin works alongside it's governance Token **FXS.** FRAX begun being **100%** backed by the centralized stablecoin USDC and from there on loosened and tightenend it's collateral policy based on demand. If the price of FRAX goes above 1$ this acts as a signal for the protocol to relax it's collateralization ratio(CR), e.g. if FRAX goes up to 1,01$ 98 cents and the 2 cents equal of **FXS** are needed to mint 1 FRAX, redemption is the same but inverse. When the price of FRAX falls, the CR tightens again. Thus the stablecoin acts similarly to a decentralized central bank. Unlike UST FRAX also managed to hold it's peg under extreme Market conditions. But like DAI it is heavily reliant on the centralized stablecoin USDC.
7. **TUSD(True USD):** is a centralized asset-backed stablecoin by TrustToken. It was born out of the perceived need for a trustworthy fully audited stablecoin as a contrast to tether. The company collabarates with banking partners that handle the underlying funds directly. TUSD is **100%** backed in cash and equivalents which is [audited in real time](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/truecurrencies). Thus TUSD can also be seen as a ""true"" stable coin regarding liquidity
8. **UST(Terra USD):** is a centralized algorithmic ""stablecoin"" by Terraform labs. It was supposed to hold it's peg through burning and minting of **LUNA** the currency of the blockchain UST works on. The extreme selling pressure on both assets led to a death spiral in which the protocol desperatly printed LUNA to hold the peg of UST further detoriating the value of LUNA and thus it's ability to back UST. The Luna Foundation Guard, a reserve that was supposed to help UST keep it's peg under extreme conditons did not suceed in it's mission. 

   10. **USDN(Neutrino Dollar):** is a decentralized asset-backed algorithmic stablecoin on the Waves   
blockchain the **WAVES** token also acts as collateral for USDN. When the price for USDN drops   
below 1$ **NSBT**, the governance token of the Neutrino system is sold to users at a cheaper price   
by the  Mechanism, reversly the contract puts tokens into a reserve fund when the price rises   
above 1$. This concept has not proven to be resilient enough under high selling pressure and   
USDN also lost it's peg in the latest crash and has not been able to regain it as of now.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4883966,public,new,self,What about Stablecoins? - a brief breakdown of the largest stablecoins,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ushd51/what_about_stablecoins_a_brief_breakdown_of_the/,,all_ads,6,1652863996.0,,,,,,dark,,,,,,,

Is it because it is the only way he can square up with some of his VCs/validators? They seem to be the only people interested in a fork.

The motto he is spouting that ""Luna is more than UST"" and about ""saving the community"" is absolutely laughable to those who lost their life savings in Luna.

Why would anyone want to buy into this new Luna? Why doesn't this ""amazing"" community just go elsewhere, like to MATIC or AVAX?  What is so special behind in the tech in Luna?  Wasn't their whole gimmick the algorithm behind UST and the backing of the LFG?  Both failed miserably.  Why do we need a hardfork?

With all of the upcoming legal issues Do Kwon has coming his way, Luna's legal counsel bailing, essentially zero reserves left, no backing by the general public for this fork, I would be be shocked if they pull off a fork or any revival efforts at all.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4883783,public,new,self,Another LUNA rant/question,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/usgf1u/another_luna_rantquestion/,,all_ads,6,1652861383.0,,,,,,dark,,,,,,,

After the recent Luna debacle and the fall from grace of UST, I've decided to start researching other stable coins and the Ecosystems around them.

Dai is the stablecoin that's caught my attention atm. My usual go to place to find information on a new project is usually Youtube. However I've faced a real lack of ""regularly updated content"" compared other more popular coins.

Does anyone have any recommendations on where to find reliable information on DAI and it's ecosystem?

Will be pasting the resources found below:

Coinbureau has excellent videos on DAI/MAKERDAO/OLYMPUS. His most recent video is from 2months ago

I've found one subreddit so far which is  r/MakerDao
