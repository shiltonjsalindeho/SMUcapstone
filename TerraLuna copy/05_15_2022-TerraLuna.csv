Or how about this? Bet you've seen responses like this a lot in certain subs:

&gt; So question is what's your buy price you put in already for LUNA? lol.   Since you state you've been looking, I'm going to assume you have 0  LUNA. 

I'm spending a lot of time in old reddit posts, reading how people reacted to events like ""FUD"", bullruns or crashes - and you should do that, too. It's easier to learn from other investor's failures than learning it by losing money yourself.

Another good advice is the ""advanced search"" on Twitter. Just check the guy you want to follow by searching something and then chosing ""Advanced search"" from the menu. You can insert a twitter account and also dates (like the weeks before the 2021 crash).",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4847676,public,self,They've been warned - but they didn't listen.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/up1vfx/theyve_been_warned_but_they_didnt_listen/,all_ads,6,1652448444.0,,dark,new

But with prices dropping, I feel this is a good time to accumulate. 

Iâ€™m planning to DCA gradually over the coming year to take advantage of lower prices but also account for volatility, which is high and likely to remain high for some time. 

I donâ€™t have a hardware wallet so Iâ€™m still wedded to CEXs for now. But as we also know, some exchanges are also experiencing liquidity problems resulting from recent price drops, increased withdrawals and the collapse of terraluna etc. Some exchanges have blocked trading and withdrawals as a result, and Iâ€™ve seen a lot of speculation about the risk of CEXs going bankrupt and peopleâ€™s investments going down with them - notably those with non-custodial investment models.

Iâ€™m not sure how much of a reality this is, but Iâ€™m interested to hear from the community which centralised exchanges people trust the most with their investments at times like these.

Iâ€™m sure there will be many who advocate for getting a hardware wallet and moving things off exchange - but Iâ€™m not yet at that stage in my crypto journey and would still need to go through and exchange to acquire crypto; so my question still stands and my main query is about trust in exchanges rather than the pros and cons of exchanges versus hardware wallets.
