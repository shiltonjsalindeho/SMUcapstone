Get your downvotes ready.

About ten days ago, [Liz Warren was getting blasted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uj4z6g/elizabeth_warrens_obsession_with_crypto_continues/) on every crypto sub for saying, "" **Investing in cryptocurrencies is a risky and speculative gamble""** and suggesting that perhaps we don't allow people to idiotically allow their life savings into risky projects .  Projects that could go to zero in a short period of time - you know, like how about 2 days?

Enter the Luna/Terra disaster.  And here I am thinking, maybe... just maybe... this woman who taught commercial and bankruptcy law classes at UPenn and Harvard might be on to something.  She is, by the way, a consistent fighter on behalf of the poor and middle class.  

But instead of her, we idolize guys like Elon who manipulate his fanboys for personal profit on a regular basis while sitting on billions and billions of dollars, avoiding taxes the whole way, and offering to fix global hunger with his money - but doesn't - and instead does shit like buying Twitter.  Which, as an aside, is [just a money-making scheme wherein he takes the company private only to pump it and dump it on the public idiots via IPO.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-plans-to-take-twitter-public-again-later-sources-say-11651609707)

And honestly, I am so fucking sick of the idiotic, skin-deep ""thinking"" of crypto libertarians.  

I get it.  You hate the government.  And taxes.  And helping people who aren't related to you.  Because you just bootstrapped yourself up with ZERO help from anyone, right??  For example:

1. You didn't attend school to learn anything via taxpayer dollars.  You're entirely self taught.
2. You built your own roads and use your own electrical and water infrastructure.
3. You don't use any of the safety net programs like unemployment, preferring to starve to fucking death in your cold, dark underpass where you live whilst unemployed.
4. You definitely aren't taking government insurance help or Medicare as an old person, preferring to be left to the whims of our for-profit health care system that will *definitely* use market forces to drive down costs, not just ask you to pay all your money for [lifesaving healthcare](https://healthcostinstitute.org/emergency-room/ouch-new-data-reveals-er-spending-increased-by-52-from-2012-2019-with-patient-out-of-pocket-payments-increasing-by-88).

Ok, sarcastic rant over.  Let me make my actual point clear here:

I understand that not everything Liz Warren says about crypto is accurate, but we need to get people like her on board and helping make this work.  Crypto has the chance to free people from many of the same people that she views as the enemy: 

* Big banks that charge exorbitant fees for sending money, changing currencies, etc.
* Investment houses and brokerages that manipulate our markets
* Corporations like Visa and Mastercard that make huge % on every purchase 
* Insurance companies that spend billions of dollars on advertising to get us to buy their shitty projects that might help, but maybe not
* Fraudsters that sell fake products 

Crypto has the chance to democratize so many things about our financial systems, taking the power away from profit-driven corporations that will just milk it, bankrupt it, and start it over.   But we aren't going to get there by fighting the government (wherever you may be), dodging our fair share of taxes, and leading people into a wild-west shit show of scammers, insane fees (looking at you, eth), and utter confusion and chaos. 

**We need to help guide the regulation, maturation, and mainstream integration of crypto.**  And people like Liz Warren, Bernie Sanders, and other progressives are the right people to help do it.  YES, we need to convince them of the validity of the concept.  YES, they are partially just advocating for dollar hegemony because it benefits the USA and gives us incredibly leverage over the rest of the world.  But the core concepts of benefiting regular people and providing us access to genuinely democratic, safe, and transparent finances are not antithetical to progressivism; they should be allies, not enemies.",False,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4860863,public,new,self,Anyone else think maybe LIZ WARREN WAS RIGHT?

For those who were quick or lucky enough to day trade it, there were probably a few 100% - 200% gainz in there. But what about the, “I’m just throwing in $20 to see what happens” guys?

Is it possible that there are no other more convincing solutions on the Terra-Luna hard fork? No, because unfortunately the trust in the current DeFi ecosystem has been devastated. It will hardly be reconquered by now.

Therefore I propose to you a possible solution on what could possibly be done:

1) It would be more appropriate to bring together all the developers of good will and good faith who have worked for the entire Terra-Luna ecosystem in recent months, not just KUJIRA (for example: Astroport, TerraSwap, Reactor Money, RetroGrade, ApolloDAO, White Whale, Leap Wallet, Mars Protocol, Nebula Protocol etc.)

2) The future Chain could be based on GNOT Land for its functioning structure, so there could be the supervision of Jae Kwon and the developers exiting Terraform Labs

3) An improved and modified version of Tendermint could be introduced to have a much more distributed and decentralized network

4) CZ and Do Kwon could offer their help on the way

5) The Coin of the reference Chain could have a ""destructive"" Tokenomics as: 
- Automatic Burning Mechanism for Fees
- Biennial or court halving to make it more and more deflationary
- A model very inspired by that of Astroport, Curve and BNB in ​​terms of use case

5) In addition, a decentralized semi-algorithmic Stablecoin could also be introduced that takes the best of the best FRAX, MIM, USN, and Silk. Sort of like UST 3.0 without that big death spiral problem.


These would be my ideas about a hypothetical future Chain to preserve the entire Terra-Luna ecosystem.

I’ve been guilty of this myself. I find some new project with a cool logo and professional website, so I try to do my due diligence and read through the whitepaper. I quickly read over the complex paragraphs of text filled with buzzwords and lofty claims, and then come all the fancy equations. I don’t understand most of them at all, and I just assume some brilliant minds came up with this stuff so it must work.

It’s funny because the Terra whitepaper goes into detail about how their algorithms and systems will keep the coin stable even when volatility is high. It all sounds great, except for one big problem: it didn’t work. I guess what I’m saying is that doing your own research doesn’t mean you’re not going to lose everything. And most importantly, something that we’ve all heard and many choose to ignore: only invest what you can afford to lose.

And at least since 2020, he has been doing it full time, as his main activity. This transition, from a job outside of trading to this exclusive dedication, he was able to make after becoming a profitable trader with consistency.   In this world, we might think that this experience is enough not to fall into too big losses. And in part, that is true. However, he was one of the thousands of people who lost money with the Terra project debacle. Although he did not invest in the LUNA token, he did have tens of thousands of dollars in his stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST).  In spite of everything, Luna decided to still 'print' more tokens by uncontrollably increasing the supply, as they could have instead repurchased their tokens with part of the fee for token burning existentially, as has been done at GMR or Minosis Token at BSC.  Via Twitter, he commented that he had lost 70% of the capital he held in UST, following the loss of the 1:1 parity between this currency and the US dollar. A parity that, in theory, he was not supposed to lose. After all, it is a ""stable"" currency. But the reality has been different.    The story of the Terra project, its stablecoin, its token and its bitcoin reserves has ended in the worst possible way: with billions of dollars in losses and a lot of people affected with devastating results. ImmortalCrypto's case was not among the worst. As he himself claims, this has been thanks to the experience and foresight he had taken.  ""The distrust that this has generated, what it will also generate is that many regulators will put the magnifying glass on the stable ones.

The act of dissolving just days before the collapse of UST suggests the intent to eliminate responsibility of the aftermath, which serves as evidence that he knew something was going to happen. On top of it all, Do Kwon's Terra foundation sent 52,189 Bitcoin to Gemini and 28,205 Bitcoin to Binance, which were intended to serve as reserves to prop up TerraUSD (UST). So what happened here? This looks like one big premeditated crime to steal 2 billion USD worth of Bitcoin by means of using Terra Luna and UST as the front.

Below is the documentation showing Terraform labs being dissolved just days before the collapse

To wit, just having some kind of established policy of stopping the chain with an *a priori consensus* determined circuit breaker on, say, 10 percent UST drops would have been HUGE.

Not to mention the Terra foundation/whomever made the decision basically causing most of these issues by permitting absolutely gargantuan amounts of UST to be traded off the central mechanism - so now people could tank the price without going through the UST-LUNA wallet/station mechanism, which basically charged a 10% escalating fee (which would accrue to LUNA holders) when withdrawals of more than 100 million UST over a day were happening. That would slowly shut down at least the LUNA printing machine quickly AND incentivize LUNA holding at that time (since you're now getting an escalating fee from the bank runners).

Obviously the coup de grace was Do Kwon's ultimate purchase of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin *with UST* (so his conjured coin) permitted those who *he gave that UST to* to now have billions of dollars worth of UST in their possession.

Perhaps the smartest thing for him to have done (in hindsight, though if you make a fucking algo stable coin, this should be obvious) is to *raise outside VC cash* and then use that fiat to buy your BTC as a backstop of last resort, if he felt that was necessary.

IMHO, starting to feel it was one big Ponzi scheme that Terra team was wanting to ride along (instead of a rug pull much sooner) because LUNA just kept mooning.

Over the past week - team kept making assurances as if everything was alright so people could keep buying and holding, when they had a pretty good sense of they were royally screwed. Some of these assurances include:

1) ""Deploying more capital, stay tight lads""

2) ""LFG is coming to rescue"" (where did the BTC go?)

3) ""We are in war room and going to share a plan shortly"" (nothing meaningful came out)

....and many more.

In the hindsight, there seems to be very little reality behind any of these. The BTC reserves has vanished. Team is pushing for fork so they can have LUNA and LUNA 2 and can artificially create market to benefit themselves. Do Kwon said he has not sold any LUNA - hard to trust, he needs to provide the proof.

Their Blockchain was designed for attack and it happened and it got screwed. Thousands of people lost real money. Terra was warned several months ago - but Do Kwon seemed too arrogant to listen. See the tweet below and feel free to dig in on the twitter:

[\(Terra was warned of possibility of such attack in Nov 2021 but Do Kwon was too arrogant to listen\)](https://preview.redd.it/w4rrriadhiz81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a68017b7429b140808945023b58fea04e042d1)

All in all, way too many red-flag with the credibility of this team. They started with a grand and much needed vision - decentralized money for a decentralized world but it seems the greed and arrogance brought everything down.

Lots of lessons to learn. Hope there is a more honest team that can bring the vision of decentralized money/ algorithmic stable coin to life.

May the force be with all the brothers and sisters who lost life's money in this Ponzi project.

The SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission) has opened a case against Terra Luna.

&amp;#x200B;

​👮‍♀️ Singapore Police are investigating Do Kwon (Terra/Luna/UST) A police report has been published, according to which an application was submitted to Do Kwon from victims of a Ponzi scheme organized by Mr. Kwon.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post:

&amp;#x200B;

Do Kwon lied and misled investors by posting false information regarding a supposed $10 billion reserve:

&amp;#x200B;

\[The $10 Billion Lie\]([https://preview.redd.it/82ti5aoytfz81.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04a79d5c35eb6b118dcfb9e4c58914b150b24a0f](https://preview.redd.it/82ti5aoytfz81.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04a79d5c35eb6b118dcfb9e4c58914b150b24a0f))

&amp;#x200B;

He then lied to investors as the ponzi scheme began falling apart by reassuring them that capital injections were coming, a plan was in place, and when it was finally revealed, he referred to the UST as ""bad debt"":  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[Lies and delaying tactics during the collapse\]([https://preview.redd.it/nhsubcxdufz81.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a42c283f9f8c6beeda2ebf3c17c01f034b07b14](https://preview.redd.it/nhsubcxdufz81.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a42c283f9f8c6beeda2ebf3c17c01f034b07b14))

&amp;#x200B;

10 Days before the ponzi scheme collapsed, Do Kwon laughs and preens for a wannabee crypto starlet while saying it's entertaining watching companies fail:

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://twitter.com/laughingmantwit/status/1524693513807581185](https://twitter.com/laughingmantwit/status/1524693513807581185)\]([https://twitter.com/laughingmantwit/status/1524693513807581185](https://twitter.com/laughingmantwit/status/1524693513807581185))

&amp;#x200B;

He knew good and well UST and Luna would collapse because he had already tried this before with ""Basis Cash"" which similarly fell to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/)\]([https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/))

&amp;#x200B;

Tens of thousands of people lost everything this past week while holding a supposedly ""stable"" coin, which was supposed to have a massive reserve war chest. As with all ponzi schemes, it turned out the collateral was far less than investors were lead to believe, and now on top of everything, Kwon himself is suggesting that the remaining funds be used to bail out existing token holders, of which himself and TFL are among the largest. He is effectively redirecting the majority of the remaining funds back into his own pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

In consultation with an attorney, and with Senator Warren's office, who is aiding in an upcoming FBI cybercrime investigation, I propose the community rally behind a class action lawsuit charging Kwon, TFL, the LFG, and Anchor affiliates with conspiracy to commit fraud. Financial crimes in crypto once occurred with very little consequence, but those days are over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even early crypto frauds did result in some degree of prosecution, as Mt. Gox's CEO learned the hard way:

&amp;#x200B;

CEO Karpelès was arrested in August 2015 by Japanese police and charged with fraud and embezzlement, and manipulating the Mt. Gox computer system to increase the balance in an account

&amp;#x200B;

On 14 March 2019, the Tokyo District Court found Karpelès guilty of falsifying data to inflate Mt. Gox's holdings by $33.5 million, for which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

In today's increasingly institutionalized crypto world, and given the scale of Kwon's ponzi scheme with loss estimates in the $10's of billions, Kwon is almost certainly going to prison. The only question is how much of the stolen funds can still be recovered from his personal holdings. As with Maddoff, considerable value was discovered in a variety of physical assets ranging from homes, to yachts, paintings, and offshore accounts. Kwon is likely hiding funds as we speak. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's time for the South Korean Financial Services Commission to declare an immediate receivership of TFL and all of Do Kwon's holdings. Victims of the ponzi scheme are encouraged to contact them directly and press for immediate action:

""Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (Gemini have just denied apprently on twitter… ). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.
When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA , was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christsake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.
Blackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out.""

""Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (Gemini have just denied apprently on twitter… ). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.
When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly.

""Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (Gemini have just denied apprently on twitter… ). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.
When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait.

But why?

The number of LUNAs has increased from 340M one week ago to 6.5 trillions. Approx. 20,000 times more. 

Therefore the current LUNA price of 0.00035 USD is equivalent to 7 USD. 

However the current plan is that the current holders of LUNA will have 10% of the new LUNA according to the proposed Terra Revival Plan. 

Therefore, if you but LUNA at 0.00035 USD, you are valuing the Old LUNA at 70 USD that is the same it was one week ago. 

Remember that 6.5 trillions coins being 10% of the new LUNA iteration means that you are valuing the new LUNA chain at around 20 billion USD. 

I think that it’s overvaluing by a great margin. I wouldn’t consider to enter unless it’s valued at less 40 times less (0.000009 USD approx). Barely being a top100 coin

If si believe the new LUNA deserves to be a top50 then I would pay 0.00002 USD per LUNA

It was resumed around 11:30 UTC with some protocol updates.

First of all, the built-in orderbook exchange was closed. You still use swaps like Terraswap or Astroport, but you can't make on-chain stop and limit orders. It doesn't change much but they decided to do it.

Secondly, they stopped the UST stabilisation mechanism. Before, you could burn 1 UST to get $1 worth of Luna, since 1 UST was worth less than $1, you could then use an exchange to sell it for more UST and repeat the process. This is what caused the inflation of LUNA, since this change the LUNA supply has stabilised around 6,530,000,000,000.

Now that the inflation has stopped, people have regained faith that LUNA can recover.  LUNA has already grown 10x since the resumal. It can't go back to $80 of course, but it still has a potential of about 5x.

Since arbitrage is now disincentivised, UST is no loner backed by anything. Despite that, UST has seen a spike of 4x. This is caused by investors buying it because of LUNA's growth. It doesn't mean it's going to repeg, once the investors realize, UST is going to repeat LUNA's faith.

All of this doesn't mean that LUNA is actually going to recover to its original market cap. The abandoning of UST has removed all differences between Terra and Cosmos from which it was forked. There's no point of Terra now, which is of course bullish for Cosmos, which i have already stacked up on (I didn't have any before).
