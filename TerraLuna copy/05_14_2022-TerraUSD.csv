I heard somewhere else that there was one massive sell off from one company that triggered this whole thing.

All that doesn't matter, what he said that caught my attention is that Terra Luna has a direct effect on their stable coin. If there's too much sell pressure on Terra then their Stable coin destabilizes.

How in the hell does ANYONE think this is a good idea. Why would they design their coin like that. There is no way that they didn't think of what the implications of a stock market crash would have. 

So i may be wrong about all of this but that's what the guy was saying.

If that's true, then that opens up a whole conspiracy aspect of this conversation. Was it designed to fail from the very beginning to speed up regulation on the industry?

And from what i hear, there are people who saw this coming and were trying to warn others.

The quick way in which the market has spiralled downwards, is shocking at best.
Market sentiment is negative. Cash flow is reducing. Interest rates have risen, as a result of the Governments' policy move to curb inflation.
I read that inflation in the US is around 8 percent, which far exceeds the expected inflation rate(around 2 percent).

The stock markets are down too, but not in a completely bearish state yet since prices have gone down only 15 percent(when i checked yesterday).

What do you think is the future of the vast potential you thought the crypto currency market and blockchain technology has to offer?

I think UST coin has us all feeling some type of way. We all for the most part knew the risk and probably we thought we were being so careful. I mean as long as its $1 to 1 UST. We can't lose, right? Well we messed up and were greedy. We all did our research, we all believed this was ""safe"" or at least safe enough. I'm creating this form just for people to express their losses, to reaffirm that we are not crazy. This really was a solid project. We all calculated the risk, but we can't control the world and it works in mysterious ways. The timing seems to off, right before the feds start talking about regulation and right as most of us were about to take out some UST for the upcoming bear/recession money. I will admit, I believe there is very shady people behind this. However, we do have to take responsibility for our actions. Let never forgot and learn. Now please use this form to express the frustration, your mindset and defend why you thought this was a ""safe enough"" plan. I will go first...

&amp;#x200B;

Anchor protocol kept coming up in my feeds, in YouTube channels and other media. I thought ""no way"" this isn't possible, but as it kept popping up. It was still working, people were using it. Months went by. How could this still be prosperous? So I looked into the coins. TerraUSD (UST) and Luna. I researched the hell out of this algorithmic process and was convinced. I mean it made sense. Luna helped UST, UST helped Luna, the liquidity was enough, process was proven to be able to recover (twice). So I bought some Luna around 40$ and was like ""Okay we will see"". For UST,  I was skeptical about going through the annoying process of buying on an exchange. (I used Gemini, not a ton of options in NY as NY requires a ""bit license"" ) transferring to Kucoin to get UST and finally hooking up terra station/anchor.  In a month, I earned more than I had earned in any bank in my life. It works! I transferred a small amount out and as promised it was 1:1 with USD. I got addicted to that easy cash. Let me be clear, I knew it wasn't sustainable and got scared in February, but once they pumped the reserves I really start transferring in all my stable coin into UST. Now I will admit I did diversify my savings. However, I only recently got a ""real job"" in the last 5 months (I'm 22, just about 23). So my net worth is still pretty low, but it was about 20% of my net worth. Nonetheless, I was super careful, checked anchor daily and for further convincing. I was able to sell my Luna at just about peak $116. However, I did spend 1/4 of those profits buying the dip which is basically worth 0$ now. Anyways, between Do Kwon, the BTC backing, the yield reserves. I truly do not believe I was incorrect in thinking I had at the very least. A few weeks before considering pulling out completely. I have spent much of this week thinking about the others who do not have time on their hands to regain losses, losing their savings, or worse not being able to afford their house, bills, or other debts. Again, we knew the risk, but I do NOT believe we should be beating ourselves mentally or physically over this. The signs were ""safe...enough"" until entities beyond our control dissembled those signs out of nowhere. We weren't crazy, but we were greedy. Let's learn so people don't get hurt again. If its too good to be true, then it probably is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this form can at least start healing process for many. Or at least claim back sanity for others. Please do not attack others and respect people's stories.

       Here are some of the main factors leading to the current slump.
1)Bitcoin is connected to the rest of the financial market.
      Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency, has no central issuer or authority controlling it. That independence from government, many argued, should ensure that Bitcoin would hold its value through economic dips, international wars or drastic policy changes.
But the last couple of years have proven this is false. When the coronavirus pandemic crushed global markets in March 2020, so too fell Bitcoin, falling by 57%. Stock markets and cryptocurrencies then both recovered and rose at a staggering rate, which analysts believe was caused by a combination of free time, disposable income, and pandemic-relief money pumped into the world by governments.
But lately, investors have been wary that change is in the air, as inflation led the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates. For investors looking for a safe port, Bitcoin, which swings wildly by nature, may seem too risky.
crypto evangelists predict that Bitcoin‚Äôs price will decouple from the stock market down the road‚Äîbut for now, the two are very much intertwined.

2)Crypto is inherently volatile.
     Even the biggest crypto boosters will tell you that success in the crypto world is far from guaranteed. Its volatility is part of its very appeal to many speculators: that they could make money at rates far faster than that of normal stock brokers.
But with the promise of the boom also comes that of the bust. 

3) Worries about regulation and security breaches
    Given that crypto derives some of its value from people‚Äôs belief in it, markets can be rattled by surrounding skepticism or policy changes. 
4) UST
Some experts also believe that the recent struggles of UST, TerraUSD, one of the largest stablecoins, played a role in the most recent Bitcoin crash. TerraUSD, also known as UST, is a token that is designed to always be worth $1, but sank below 70 cents on Monday as holders panicked and sold off their tokens en masse in a pseudo-bank-run.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4836914,public,new,self,Summary:Basic understanding why bitcoin keeps crashing,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uoadtp/summarybasic_understanding_why_bitcoin_keeps/,all_ads,6,1652358793.0,,,,,,

I've had quite a few people ask me this today so here's your short read on the situation.

TerraUSD (UST) is/was an algo backed stable coin pegged to the US dollar. This means that unlike fiat and crypto backed stable coins (e.g USDC, GUSD etc) which hold $1 in custody for every 1 blockchain-based representation, UST tries to maintain a peg by incentivising the ecosystem to mint and burn it's sister token LUNA. 

This is because you can always redeem 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA, even if UST is less than $1. The exchange rate is fixed. 

This means that is UST is trading at $0.99 then market participants will buy it and redeem it for $1 of LUNA to grab the arbitrage opportunity and pocket some pennies.

Up until last mont, UST was backed only by buying and selling of LUNA however in order to bolster reserves against potential market volatility, the Luna Guard Foundation (the non-profit behind the Terra ecosystem) started buying billions of dollars of bitcoin (BTC) and avalanche (AVAX) to add to the treasury. The plan was that they could sell this if things between UST and LUNA started to get challenging.

Then last Saturday we saw the price of UST fall from the ideal $1 mark to around $0.985 (which now looks pretty modest!) and the founder of Terra (the blockchain where LUNA and UST live) tweeted that this was the action of a large whale who had deliberately sold over $180m worth of their UST holdings to crash the price and take profits from a short position. 

In response to this market shock the Luna Guard Foundation announced on Sunday that they would pump $1.5billion of their BTC reserves into the mini-economy to re-instate the peg. This worked for a little while ....

However just last night we saw an even bigger shock to the price with UST falling down to $0.694 üò±

So why is this all happening ...

-- The Luna Foundation Guard are blaming wider crypto market moves downwards, especially the falling BTC price
-- Do Kwon blamed a malicious whale for starting it all
-- Some have claimed that there was market confusion/FUD about the treasury selling BTC to maintain the peg and it scared some paperhands off
-- I think it's also important to consider another part of the Terra ecosystem which is connected to UST - Anchor protocol. This is a a money market where if you deposit UST you can earn up to 19.5% APY returns. However, this isn't a sustainable return and Anchor know this. In fact with the recent drop in wider cryptocurrency market prices it's expected they have only a few months runway left before the treasury account paying out these staking rewards is empty. This is likely to have had an impact on the drop in UST confidence. 

So what happens next?! We'll need to see whether UST bounces back (like it did after de-pegging last year) either by market participants apeing into LUNA or the LFG further selling treasury funds to stabilise the peg. üî≠",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4836603,public,new,self,What‚Äôs going on with UST?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uo9k6j/whats_going_on_with_ust/,all_ads,6,1652356522.0,,,,,,
