In another video which is from the same interview Do Kwon is talking about Terra **""going back to nothing.""** Here is what he said **:**

**“It’s a cycle of life. You begin from nothing and go back to nothing. That’s exactly where I want to be. So I think Terra’s going to be a decentralized money standard across the entire blockchain, across all of the blockchains. And I’m excited for Terraform Labs to contribute a significant portion of that early vision, but eventually to go back to nothing.”** He also said Terra going back to nothing is **“Exciting”**.

According to a local news report, this is because it is currently difficult to safeguard investors due to the multiple ways in which risk is measured in each virtual asset exchange. Although FSS standardization efforts are still in their infancy, when a legal framework for virtual assets has been established, it is expected that a uniform assessment system can be implemented for all exchanges.

Mainly everything has been driven by the fall of Terra and the emergence of the new Project 2.0 as well as the need to intervene pre-sales of DeFi (decentralized finance) projects or protocols that move large amounts of money, be it blockchains like Ethereum or BNB, which tend to have the largest stratups of blockchain projects. Pre-sales such as CHO, Minosis Token or UNI at the time.

On Wednesday, Stablenode COO Doo Wan Nam tweeted that a meeting was held at the Korean National Assembly Building with representatives of Korean exchanges and officials regarding Terra's LUNA and UST issues. The exchanges, according to Doo, said the situation was undesirable and that they would do everything possible to safeguard traders on their platforms.

Heraldcorp reported Wednesday that Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, has contacted five South Korean exchanges about re-listing when LUNA 2.0 goes live. However, since LUNA is under investigation after its failure, other South Korean platforms are staying on the sidelines, except Upbit.

CEO Kwon's ""Terra Ecosystem Restoration Plan"" is a plan to create new coins and give them to investors who have lost money. ""Let's call the current Terra blockchain network 'Terra Classic,' and the current Luna blockchain, 'Luna Classic,' and create a new Terra blockchain,"" CEO Kwon tweeted on May 18.

The majority of the community, 65.5%, supported Kwon's plan. Only 13.2% opposed the fork vote. About 20% of respondents abstained from voting. On Friday, according to the proposal information, Terra 2.0 is scheduled to go live on the main network. After this launch, LUNA 2.0 coins will be tradable. At a predetermined rate, the new tokens will be delivered to current network participants. However, most of the coins will go through a period of consolidation.

The plan to relaunch the Terra blockchain and create LUNA 2.0 tokens has been approved by on-chain voters. This will lead to the development of a new blockchain that will distribute tokens proportionally to those who were affected by the abrupt crash of the UST algorithmic stablecoin.

Terra's controversial USD 40 billion bankruptcy has been the subject of much debate in the Korean and global cryptocurrency community. As Cointelegraph reported, Korean exchanges handled the collapse in different ways, and the National Assembly's Political Affairs Committee summoned Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon for a parliamentary hearing on the issue.

Now, the outspoken 30-year-old South Korean, who frequently calls his critics ""poor,"" is being called upon to explain this month's USD 40 billion collapse of a project he once called ""the oldest and most widely used algorithmic stablecoin in existence.""",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4922353,public,self,,,Korean watchdog begins assessing cryptocurrency risk after vote held for Terra 2.0 project,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uyfg21/korean_watchdog_begins_assessing_cryptocurrency/,all_ads,6,1653564567.0
