They are definitely not fully backed as historically they never were fully backed by dollars, so if large holders try cash out and dont get their cash , the peg between USDT and USD may break as people run for the exits. Alternatively if they did the same scam as UST and backed their token with Bitcoin they may be forced to sell off their holdings and crash BTC.

Historical, along with current data can be found here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/historical-data/

As we know, Tether is supposed to be backed by 1:1 to the USD by Tether’s reserves. Tether allegedly has fiat, bonds, and other assets to do this (will address this a bit more below). Even though Tether is near its’ peg, the change in market cap shows an overwhelming amount of redemption.

This is concerning for a few reasons, for one because the overall market is down. Meaning, the assets in Tether’s reserve also most likely are down as well. I’m not just talking about the crypto market, either. Since we do not have full transparency in Tether’s backing, many have speculated it’s tied to assets like BTC, which is also way down as well. Meaning, their backing “power” may be lower than it was previously and not exactly at 1:1.

As an example, for arguments sake, let’s say that BTC was bought and fully backed the USDT. Their average price for backing was when Bitcoin was at 30k. Now let’s say the market dips, and bitcoin goes to 27k. At the same time, many start redeeming Tether to cash out to fiat out of fear of the market conditions. This means that the backing of Tether is no longer 1:1 and since people are redeeming, Tether would have to sell off its bitcoin reserves for a loss of 10% to cover the redemption.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4860817,public,,self,If USDT did the same scam as UST and backed their token with Bitcoin they may be forced to sell off their holdings and crash BTC and USDT in the process.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uq7m75/if_usdt_did_the_same_scam_as_ust_and_backed_their/,all_ads,6,1652597211.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anything can happen, not financial advice, especially coming from someone who just lost a $30,000 loan @ 25% APR without disposable income (see my post history) trying to long Algorand at .68 cents with a 4x margin.

If it goes to 0, it goes to 0, but I’m hearing from some who had ‘Xxnx’ who bought a few million at .000006 and are sitting on a generous couple thousand as it’s ‘recovering’ to quadruple 0’s. If it can go $100+ to $0.000006 in a few days, anything can happen in the positive direction. 

Could it go to 0? Maybe. It might even go negative at this point.

Do I know this 20 year old Kwon guy or why people hate him so much? No.

Do I even know what the project entails? No.

Will exchanges do whatever they want in case they decide to fork or split of some sort to compensate new buyers? No idea.

Was I a long-time holder? No. But if I was I wouldn’t sell at a loss. I would buy the dip, like the imbecile that I am. Again, not financial advice. At this point though… it’s just whatever. 

Do I want people to not give up on something I know nothing about because I think they can turn this around for everyone and because I made a tiny profit and I am greedy? Yes.

Do I understand the UST mechanics? No, and I don’t care much for technicals either, as long as the project has a name for itself at this point.

Idk about you but I’m going to bet on the moon boys. Life’s short. I will succeed or go broke trying. Most likely the latter.

(Also, please no toxic comments about my cat ‘Lxma’, you will seriously hurt our feelings, she’s less than a year old, thank you)

**Anything.Can.Happen**

**My condolences to those sitting on heavy debt/loss and trust me although I wasn’t in this ‘Lxnx’ business earlier trust me I’m right there with you due to previous series’ of events**

However, Luna has come roaring back as meme coin and I don't think Binance wants you to know. Here are my observations: 

* As a background Binance bought CoinMarketCap in 2020.
* Based on public sentiment, we  know that UST/Luna is a hot topic trending in the crypto community. Last night I saw it listed as the highest trending crypto on CoinMarketCap. But then a few minutes later it quietly disappeared from that section of CoinMarketCap.

[This is the section from which it quietly disappeared.](https://preview.redd.it/iq54b7mw4nz81.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b3d1530f8d2e0d560e2fc8163188085e2f9b34)

* As Luna crashed, Binance delisted it(earlier in the week), but then on May 13 they rel-isted it.

* On CoinMarketCap we see the market cap of Luna is about $1.783 billion USD. As a billion-dollar coin it should be listed as a top 100 crypto. Yet it's conveniently missing.

MY THEORY: Luna is a train wreck/circus. However, there is now significant value to the brand name.I believe the exchange wants to corner the market on Luna and then spike the price back up. This would have the effect of crushing short sellers. However, I believe the exchange would like to buy more Luna before the price spikes back up, therefore they are hiding this rise

Is it possible that there are no other more convincing solutions on the Terra-Luna hard fork? No, because unfortunately the trust in the current DeFi ecosystem has been devastated. It will hardly be reconquered by now.

Therefore I propose to you a possible solution on what could possibly be done:

1) It would be more appropriate to bring together all the developers of good will and good faith who have worked for the entire Terra-Luna ecosystem in recent months, not just KUJIRA (for example: Astroport, TerraSwap, Reactor Money, RetroGrade, ApolloDAO, White Whale, Leap Wallet, Mars Protocol, Nebula Protocol etc.)

2) The future Chain could be based on GNOT Land for its functioning structure, so there could be the supervision of Jae Kwon and the developers exiting Terraform Labs

3) An improved and modified version of Tendermint could be introduced to have a much more distributed and decentralized network

4) CZ and Do Kwon could offer their help on the way

5) The Coin of the reference Chain could have a ""destructive"" Tokenomics as: 
- Automatic Burning Mechanism for Fees
- Biennial or court halving to make it more and more deflationary
- A model very inspired by that of Astroport, Curve and BNB in ​​terms of use case

5) In addition, a decentralized semi-algorithmic Stablecoin could also be introduced that takes the best of the best FRAX, MIM, USN, and Silk. Sort of like UST 3.0 without that big death spiral problem.


These would be my ideas about a hypothetical future Chain to preserve the entire Terra-Luna ecosystem.

UST was sold as the stablecoin that will remain pegged to $1 but it dropped to $0.1 because the ponzi scam collapsed. LUNA became worthless overnight.  A total of $32 Billion dollars is lost.**

I’ve been guilty of this myself. I find some new project with a cool logo and professional website, so I try to do my due diligence and read through the whitepaper. I quickly read over the complex paragraphs of text filled with buzzwords and lofty claims, and then come all the fancy equations. I don’t understand most of them at all, and I just assume some brilliant minds came up with this stuff so it must work.

It’s funny because the Terra whitepaper goes into detail about how their algorithms and systems will keep the coin stable even when volatility is high. It all sounds great, except for one big problem: it didn’t work. I guess what I’m saying is that doing your own research doesn’t mean you’re not going to lose everything. And most importantly, something that we’ve all heard and many choose to ignore: only invest what you can afford to lose.

However, he was one of the thousands of people who lost money with the Terra project debacle. Although he did not invest in the LUNA token, he did have tens of thousands of dollars in his stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST).  In spite of everything, Luna decided to still 'print' more tokens by uncontrollably increasing the supply, as they could have instead repurchased their tokens with part of the fee for token burning existentially, as has been done at GMR or Minosis Token at BSC.  Via Twitter, he commented that he had lost 70% of the capital he held in UST, following the loss of the 1:1 parity between this currency and the US dollar. A parity that, in theory, he was not supposed to lose. After all, it is a ""stable"" currency. But the reality has been different.    The story of the Terra project, its stablecoin, its token and its bitcoin reserves has ended in the worst possible way: with billions of dollars in losses and a lot of people affected with devastating results. ImmortalCrypto's case was not among the worst. As he himself claims, this has been thanks to the experience and foresight he had taken.

The act of dissolving just days before the collapse of UST suggests the intent to eliminate responsibility of the aftermath, which serves as evidence that he knew something was going to happen. On top of it all, Do Kwon's Terra foundation sent 52,189 Bitcoin to Gemini and 28,205 Bitcoin to Binance, which were intended to serve as reserves to prop up TerraUSD (UST). So what happened here? This looks like one big premeditated crime to steal 2 billion USD worth of Bitcoin by means of using Terra Luna and UST as the front.

To wit, just having some kind of established policy of stopping the chain with an *a priori consensus* determined circuit breaker on, say, 10 percent UST drops would have been HUGE.

Not to mention the Terra foundation/whomever made the decision basically causing most of these issues by permitting absolutely gargantuan amounts of UST to be traded off the central mechanism - so now people could tank the price without going through the UST-LUNA wallet/station mechanism, which basically charged a 10% escalating fee (which would accrue to LUNA holders) when withdrawals of more than 100 million UST over a day were happening. That would slowly shut down at least the LUNA printing machine quickly AND incentivize LUNA holding at that time (since you're now getting an escalating fee from the bank runners).

Obviously the coup de grace was Do Kwon's ultimate purchase of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin *with UST* (so his conjured coin) permitted those who *he gave that UST to* to now have billions of dollars worth of UST in their possession. Which they then dumped in droves at the precisely right time.

Perhaps the smartest thing for him to have done (in hindsight, though if you make a fucking algo stable coin, this should be obvious) is to *raise outside VC cash* and then use that fiat to buy your BTC as a backstop of last resort, if he felt that was necessary.

We all saw a few days ago when *seemingly* the panic caused tether to temporarily lose its peg, at one point dropping to a terrifying 0.95.

But that's not all. If you look at some other stablecoins (at least those that are still stable) around the same time, you can see a pretty clear correlation to them all spiking during the moments that USDT was losing its peg. While this is just a correlation, and I certainly wouldn't be the one to dig through historical trading pair data to find a causal link, this could indicate people trying to convert their tethers into other stablecoins.

[Image](https://i.imgur.com/AtgvyOn.png)

What's more, is that it seems since the depeg, tethers have been burning at an unprecedented rate. Before the depeg tether's market cap peaked at ~83.2 billion, but since it has dropped to ~76.5 billion.

[Image](https://i.imgur.com/oap5f1T.png)

A drop in the bucket for now, but historically speaking it looks a bit more drastic.

This isn't necessarily a cause for alarm. But if people (mostly whales and exchanges) are really finally trying to get rid of their tethers, and this keeps up long enough, we'll see a 'run on the bank' kind of situation, in which Tether doesn't have enough USD to fulfil everyone's exchange orders, and the long prophesied Tether implosion finally happens.

Or I could just be panicking based on some coinmarketcap charts. We'll see how well this post ages.

The SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission) has opened a case against Terra Luna.

&amp;#x200B;

​👮‍♀️ Singapore Police are investigating Do Kwon (Terra/Luna/UST) A police report has been published, according to which an application was submitted to Do Kwon from victims of a Ponzi scheme organized by Mr. Kwon.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post:

&amp;#x200B;

Do Kwon lied and misled investors by posting false information regarding a supposed $10 billion reserve:

&amp;#x200B;

\[The $10 Billion Lie\]([https://preview.redd.it/82ti5aoytfz81.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04a79d5c35eb6b118dcfb9e4c58914b150b24a0f](https://preview.redd.it/82ti5aoytfz81.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04a79d5c35eb6b118dcfb9e4c58914b150b24a0f))

&amp;#x200B;

He then lied to investors as the ponzi scheme began falling apart by reassuring them that capital injections were coming, a plan was in place, and when it was finally revealed, he referred to the UST as ""bad debt"":  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[Lies and delaying tactics during the collapse\]([https://preview.redd.it/nhsubcxdufz81.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a42c283f9f8c6beeda2ebf3c17c01f034b07b14](https://preview.redd.it/nhsubcxdufz81.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a42c283f9f8c6beeda2ebf3c17c01f034b07b14))

&amp;#x200B;

10 Days before the ponzi scheme collapsed, Do Kwon laughs and preens for a wannabee crypto starlet while saying it's entertaining watching companies fail:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He knew good and well UST and Luna would collapse because he had already tried this before with ""Basis Cash"" which similarly fell to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/)\]([https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/11/usts-do-kwon-was-behind-earlier-failed-stablecoin-ex-terra-colleagues-say/))

&amp;#x200B;

Tens of thousands of people lost everything this past week while holding a supposedly ""stable"" coin, which was supposed to have a massive reserve war chest. As with all ponzi schemes, it turned out the collateral was far less than investors were lead to believe, and now on top of everything, Kwon himself is suggesting that the remaining funds be used to bail out existing token holders, of which himself and TFL are among the largest. He is effectively redirecting the majority of the remaining funds back into his own pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

In consultation with an attorney, and with Senator Warren's office, who is aiding in an upcoming FBI cybercrime investigation, I propose the community rally behind a class action lawsuit charging Kwon, TFL, the LFG, and Anchor affiliates with conspiracy to commit fraud. Financial crimes in crypto once occurred with very little consequence, but those days are over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even early crypto frauds did result in some degree of prosecution, as Mt. Gox's CEO learned the hard way:

&amp;#x200B;

CEO Karpelès was arrested in August 2015 by Japanese police and charged with fraud and embezzlement, and manipulating the Mt. Gox computer system to increase the balance in an account

&amp;#x200B;

On 14 March 2019, the Tokyo District Court found Karpelès guilty of falsifying data to inflate Mt. Gox's holdings by $33.5 million, for which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

In today's increasingly institutionalized crypto world, and given the scale of Kwon's ponzi scheme with loss estimates in the $10's of billions, Kwon is almost certainly going to prison. The only question is how much of the stolen funds can still be recovered from his personal holdings. As with Maddoff, considerable value was discovered in a variety of physical assets ranging from homes, to yachts, paintings, and offshore accounts. Kwon is likely hiding funds as we speak. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's time for the South Korean Financial Services Commission to declare an immediate receivership of TFL and all of Do Kwon's holdings. Victims of the ponzi scheme are encouraged to contact them directly and press for immediate action:

""Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (Gemini have just denied apprently on twitter… ). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.
When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA , was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christsake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.
Blackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out.""

20-30% survival rate, and she’s still hanging in there. She’s eating well (so far), and smells like hell although we can’t bathe her properly aside from wet wipes because of her recently closed incisions. She can barely let out a faint meow, and we can’t even use regular kitty litter anymore—every morning we rip up some newspaper after cleaning her litter box.

Anyways, it gets more dark and graphic. Not sure if I could even post videos/images if I wanted to, if I ever even dared to share something like what she went through. Her vet went as far as to say it could be feline covid (tinfoil hat moment for him). Although this sounds like rambling nonsense and a possibly drunken, incoherent comparison of my cat Luma’s current recovery to Luna’s potentially imminent demise… I have one thing to say.


Buy. At. Least. A. Little. Luna. JUST. In. CASE. (Not financial advice)

Anything can happen, not financial advice, especially coming from someone who just lost a $30,000 loan @ 25% APR without disposable income (see my post history) trying to long Algorand at .68 cents with a 4x margin.

If it goes to 0, it goes to 0, but I’m hearing from some who had Luna who bought a few million at .000006 and are sitting on a generous couple thousand as it’s ‘recovering’ to quadruple 0’s. If it can go $100+ to $0.000006 in a few days, anything can happen in the positive direction. 

Could it go to 0? Maybe. It might even go negative at this point.

Do I know this 20 year old Kwon guy or why people hate him so much? No.

Do I even know what the project entails? No.

Was I a long-time holder? No. But if I was I wouldn’t sell at a loss. I would buy the dip, like the imbecile that I am. Again, not financial advice. At this point though… it’s just whatever. 

Do I want people to not give up on something I know nothing about because I think they can turn this around for everyone and because I made a tiny profit and I am greedy? Yes.

Do I understand the UST mechanics? No, and I don’t care much for technicals either, as long as the project has a name for itself at this point.

Idk about you but I’m going to bet on the moon boys, we can be in this together. Life’s short so let’s do what we do best. Succeed or go broke trying. 

(Also, please no toxic comments about my cat Luma, you will seriously hurt our feelings, she’s less than a year old, thank you)

Today, I see Tron Chain has gone up 14.78% in TVL.

Once I go and check the protocols I see JustLend as the top protocol within the chain.

Within the protocol, I see that USDD (a stable coin) is providing 19.94%. Now, i understand that this is a lending protocol and therefore the people that are borrowing will ultimately pay for this interest. Given what has happened this week with the whole debacle of UST and Luna, I decided to take a read into its whitepaper.

[https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf](https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf)

Now, onto point 5 in this whitepaper:

""  Adjustment of short-term price fluctuation 

The USDD protocol runs on the TRON network, of which TRX is the native token and the most natural defense against USDD price fluctuations. The USDD protocol uses TRX as the base currency to price USDD. The USDD protocol maintains the market price of USDD around the target price regardless of market conditions using the following method: 

● When USDD's price &lt; 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USDD to 1USD worth of TRX in the protocol. When 1USDD = 0.9USD, an arbitrageur can buy 1USDD with 0.9USD in the external market and then swap 1USDD for 1USD worth of TRX in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USD worth of TRX in the external market at 1USD. In this way, the arbitrageur spends 0.9USD to get 1USD, and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USDD will be burned, and 1USD worth of TRX will be minted. As the supply of USDD decreases, USDD's price will increase, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD. 

● When USDD's price &gt; 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USD worth of TRX to 1 USDD in the protocol. When 1USDD = 1.1USD, an arbitrageur can pay 1USD for TRX of the same value in the external market and then swap 1USD worth of TRX for 1USDD in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USDD in the external market at 1.1USD. The arbitrageur spends 1USD to get 1.1USD and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USD worth of TRX will be burned, and 1USDD will be minted. As the supply of USDD rises, USDD's price will go down, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD. ""

&amp;#x200B;

How is this different from Luna/UST? 

USDD has a market cap of 300M$ at this point.

I have lost it all. Wife, kids, everything. I can not see any reason to hold on anymore.

5 years ago I found the love of my life, she being in my country on a limited residence permit, I choose to go with her to her home country. I left my job and started a new life in a new country. Us being stupid in love, with no jobs, we decided to marry and have kids. A little daughter came.. The only money we had was my life savings. Those came short, and I put the small amount I had left, into UST, hoping for a better future. Then the depeg happened. Had a hard time telling my wife, who is now filing for divorce, taking our daughter with me.

Here I am, tired, sleepless, with nothing more than myself and a small apartment that I can no longer pay for. I dont see any purpose of life anymore. I have lost it all, and no sign of light. I might just end it now. Then atleast it was my own choice. 

To anybody who wants to know, I have lost about 10k, as seen by my wallet terra15qwulea6ln7kg39u8m3tmsx7ljqwpv8udxathd I know many have lost more. Hope they will go through this, though i wont.

Money is hard to make. People work their ass off for $14 an hour, flipping burgers, and cleaning garbage. If you're lucky, you go to school and get a good paying job where you can buy a property, take care of yourself and your family, and invest some.

These people thought they found an infinite free money hub. Who has ever heard of 20% interest outside of a ponzi scheme?

FTM and NEAR I am down 60%, I am not sure of the future of FTM at this point but I am too down to exit and I think it will rebound at least a bit, so I am waiting...while I strongly believe in the future of NEAR and USN structure looks not at risk of a death spiral like UST, although I feel a bit of cold feet now on NEAR.

SOL, DOT, ATOM, MATIC, at today’s prices, look like great risk/reward plays. I am also seriously considering to enter in ADA, having observed its relative resilience compared to the other coins, but still a bit concerned by its massive market cap - what do you guys think?

There's war happening in Europe between Ukraine and Russia and the overall markets are in a big decline. Inflation is at an all time high.

These are all perfect conditions for creating a huge market crash like we had back in 2018 that went on for almost 2 years until the bull run started in 2021 (some argue we had a bull run in 2020).

If we look at some other similarities within our space you have the recent crash in LUNA.

Luna &amp; UST were  top 10 coins that left investors ruined when they both crashed. Seemingly there is some type of discussions within their community and attempts to save the projects.

Now I don't want to compare projects but here but...anyone else getting flashbacks to BitConnect crash in 2018? I'm not looking to smear campaign LUNA here, BitConnect was an obvious scam and a pyramide scheme. And LUNA still hosts a vibrant ecosystem of dApps. But fact remains both were top10 projects that crashed overnight.

Another good example I came to think about was Yearn Finance and Fantom. Yearns founder and Fantoms main developer Andre Cronje left the space leaving both projects in a free fall from their previous all time highs.

That it is just a big random number which is unique and which people want to own and exchange for real money, just in the hope that in future someone will buy it from them at a higher price.

12 years ago Bitcoin originally actually set out to replace the dollar and other currencies across the entire world, because the fiat currencies were controlled by their govts, who could stop international transactions when they wanted just be denying citizens the right to purchase other fiat. It was a one-world one-currency vision of human beings being allowed to take financial decisions independent of their govts.

BTC was never meant to be an investment. It was meant to be a currency which could serve both as a Medium of Exchange (for all type of goods and services across the world) and a Store of Value (when you could store it for future use without it changing its original value), while also providing users both reliability of transactions, and privacy from govt and tax snooping. It wanted to circumvent banking delays and intermediary fees such as currency exchanging fees in fiat transaction.

However somewhere along the way, the idea was picked up and it got treated as an investment and not as a currency, It lost its currency trajectory and was hijacked into the investment orbit. This was followed by Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. et all. In fact all the crypto coins are not currencies at all in the original sense. 

The search for the real crypto currency is still on.

The LUNA attack was a planned attack on a well known weakness of the UST-LUNA algorithm that was designed only for upswing cycles, but more than the callous owner who risked the savings of millions of gullible investors, it was the whale which actually executed the attack who needs to be brought to book. The entire crypto ecosystem is characterised by non-accountability, lack of transparency, and no rules for the hit and run criminals. There are no system or standards of audit or disclosures of profitablity and ownership, other than PoS, of funding or business models, or of coins yet to be mined, or any culpabilty enforcement mechanism for investor protection. As the moderator in the Bankless podcast of the LUNA attack famously said, we are at the frontiers of the future and driving West. But all the more reason to carry life jackets, knives and oxygen cylinders like deep sea divers, or crash helmets, and radiation protection suits and communication systems like astronauts. It would be childish to explore the frontiers of the future wearing only slippers. 

 What is true for crypto coins is even more valid for DeFi. The basic difference between savings and investments is that savings do not shoot up or down because they are held in form of stable assets (property, gold, cash or bank deposits) where they are not expected to fetch high returns. Investments on the other hand, are expected to fetch returns and can move up or down depending on external factors.

Till the day DeFi is backed by a stable currency, it can never be used as a financial instrument for lending or borrowing, as long as more stable fiat alternatives exist. The unpleasant dichotomy is that as soon as a DeFi crypto coin becomes a medium of savings by becoming stable, it would no longer be seen as an investment. DeFi cryptos are currently torn between promoting themselves as transaction instruments or investments.

By 2023 we should be seeing at least 3-4 full fledged CBDCs on the market, Honk Kong HKMAs mBridge, Singapore MAS project, Nigeria's eNaira (already onstream), China's e-yuan, Russian e-rouble, Swedish e-Kroner and so on. The LUNA fiasco will only help the rapid deployment of the CBDCs. These projects are expected to incorporate in DeFi play from the beginning. backed by fiat currencies and soverign guarantees, with institutional control. These should be accepted readily by banks and FIs , being well equipped to become the true drivers of future finance. Sadly, DeFi crypto coins poudly proclaimed as ""currencies of the future"" may become relics of digital history in 2-3 years. The only ones to survive may be the ones that enter into development tie up with any major CBDC. These CBDC -crypto alliances are likely to survive for sometime more after which Defi play is expected to be monopolized by CBDCs only. 

The writing is on the wall.

It was resumed around 11:30 UTC with some protocol updates.

First of all, the built-in orderbook exchange was closed. You still use swaps like Terraswap or Astroport, but you can't make on-chain stop and limit orders. It doesn't change much but they decided to do it.

Secondly, they stopped the UST stabilisation mechanism. Before, you could burn 1 UST to get $1 worth of Luna, since 1 UST was worth less than $1, you could then use an exchange to sell it for more UST and repeat the process. This is what caused the inflation of LUNA, since this change the LUNA supply has stabilised around 6,530,000,000,000.

Now that the inflation has stopped, people have regained faith that LUNA can recover.  LUNA has already grown 10x since the resumal. It can't go back to $80 of course, but it still has a potential of about 5x.

Since arbitrage is now disincentivised, UST is no loner backed by anything. Despite that, UST has seen a spike of 4x. This is caused by investors buying it because of LUNA's growth. It doesn't mean it's going to repeg, once the investors realize, UST is going to repeat LUNA's faith.

All of this doesn't mean that LUNA is actually going to recover to its original market cap. The abandoning of UST has removed all differences between Terra and Cosmos from which it was forked. There's no point of Terra now, which is of course bullish for Cosmos, which i have already stacked up on (I didn't have any before).

1. **""Stable""coins -** Tether has missed it's 2022 Q1 reserves report: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uelepc/tether_has_missed_its_2022_q1_reserves_report/) In comparison: in 2007 a bank with $18B in dealings  (Lehman Bros.) took down the whole market. Tether is ""worth"" about $70B. The UST desaster gave a little preview of what can happen to USDT.
2. **19.5% APY -** If it sounds too good to be true, it most likely isn't true. Pressure on prices gets a lot of projects into big trouble. People are still waiting to cash out, since a lot of money is locked. The death of UST / LUNA made people question their investments. The CRO desaster did its part, too - credibility was lost.
3. **Escalating war in Europe -** Russian state TV is already talking about tactics for invading Baltic states: [news](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17965158/russian-state-tv-discusses-invasion-seizing-baltic-states/) / Russia's Duma parliament is making poland the next target: [link](https://www.latestly.com/socially/world/just-in-russias-state-duma-deputy-proposed-to-put-poland-next-in-line-for-latest-tweet-by-disclose-tv-3704154.html)
4. **European Union is considering a PoW prohibition -** Behind closed doors, EU officials talk about banning Bitcoin: [netzpolitik.org](https://netzpolitik.org/2022/climate-measures-behind-closed-doors-eu-officials-talk-about-banning-bitcoin/). Could be bad for PoW, but even PoS-coins would follow the market as usual.
5. **NFT market has already surpassed its climax -** NFT owners are getting nervous: [market report](https://nonfungible.com/news/corporate/nft-market-report-q1-2022) People are offering 30k for an NFT that once was 1.5M: [first tweet](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x28009881f0ffe85c90725b8b02be55773647c64a/20/)  
The rising market for NFTs is what fuled the rally of several coins. If the NFT market is losing marketcap, related coins will lose value, too.
6. **Inflation and possible recession -** If you think Bitcoin is immune to inflation - inflation means people have less money to invest, since expenses grow faster than income. We all know crypto is young and never experienced something like this. We'll see.
7. **Mass adoption? El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy continues to lose steam after 8 months**  
The recent crash will lower the chances of mass adoption. A failure of the current (seemingly instable) regime in El Salvador could lead to the country leaving BTC for good:  [link](https://fortune.com/2022/04/27/el-salvador-bitcoin-strategy-chivo-losses/)
8. **Evergrande** \- Admit it, you forgot about evergrande. They still exist and it's still not over. Now that we're facing a recession (especially on housing markets), evergrande gets even more in danger: [Warning of debt blowoff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/sunac-fails-to-make-bond-interest-payment-evergrande-update).
9. **Michael Saylor** \- The CEO of Microstrategies is known as the father of all BTC maxis. He sounds crazier every week with tweets that sound like bible verses. A ticking time bomb since the price of BTC is under pressure, while MS holds 129,218 Bitcoin right now. Please note that Microstrategies is still a company dedicated to business inteligence, not an investment fund.

This could easily become a self-forfilling prophecy, since people fear their investments could be lost in a bankrupcy.

I personally think it's a buying opportunity, even though it seems very risky. A lot of people in this sub think prices will drop further, but the majority is known for making false predictions. No financial advice though. My investment will just go on no matter what happens.
