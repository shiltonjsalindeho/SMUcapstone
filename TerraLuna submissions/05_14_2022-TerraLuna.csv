Full disclosure, I’ve never owned UST or Luna.

When I was studying math during my time as an economics student up to grad school, my professors always told me that Econometrics was the future of where the economics field is going and pressured me into taking essentially just Econ theory and statistics courses.

Fast forward to my PhD microeconomics exam which was essentially all set theory proofs “I was supposed to already know” and I am screwed. I like my program, but I realize I have a lot of catching up to do before I could accomplish what I want out of it. I get a 55% in the exam and drop out finding a master’s degree level job. 

One could say that my PhD studies failed not because I am a bad economics student but rather that I missed an important flow of information because my professors were incentivized by the market to push out econometricians and not theorists. If you lost money in crypto and are doubting your intelligence due to not knowing the issues with algorithmic stable coins it could be the case that you are not bad at doing research or are just stupid, but rather you are insulated in an environment that is incentivized to provide you with one set of information and not the other.

Always diversify if you can, if it’s too good to be true it probably is, read as much as possible, and perhaps pick up a math or Econ or finance textbook before you jump all in.

It sounds rather cliché, but its a lesson I had to learn the hard way these past few days. Up until that point, life was pretty decent for me. I've worked in the medical for the past 7 years and make decent money. I have been blessed with amazing colleagues and wonderful friends. I have a beautiful wife and the greatest children a father could ever ask for. I was also fortunate enough to buy a house in 2020, being the first in my known family to own one. Alot of what I've gained in my adult life not only came from hard work, but luck as well. I've been investing in crypto since 2018, and while I haven't made anything life changing, I've made enough to where I could buy things I normally couldn't freely afford (such as a car for my wife). I'm not a seasoned pro at investing, but I have enough experience to know how the markets worked. Or, so I thought. The evening of May 9th not only changed my perspective of crypto, it changed my life as well. Back in June of 2021, I came across something called TerraLuna. I had read all these amazing things about the project, and was instantly convinced. In addition, its marketcap at the time was relatively low and I felt the price of $6 was a steal. And fuck, was it. By December of that year, the price had hit around $100 and I had made around $200k profit. While most would have taken those gains, I was a bit more reluctant to do so as I knew it would instantly trigger that dreaded 37% short gain tax. I knew the price would dip eventually, but I figured it would be better to lose any potential gains from the ATH than to pay more in taxes. So the plan was to hold onto it for exactly 1 year to date and then sell, which would've been 1 more month. 

1..more..fucking..month.. 

That was all I needed to have a nice nest egg to reinvest or retire on. But it seems fate had other plans for me. Working in a hospital, I don't have time to constantly check my phone for crypto updates. Heck, between working long hours and all the depressing news in the market, I barely even cared to look. The times I did look, the outcome was the same: long red stripes with the occasional specks of green strewn about. It wasn't until I had a day off and was going through my YouTube feed that I discovered the grizzly news - UST had lost its peg, causing the price to plummet to unrecoverable levels, bringing Luna down with it. It was a moment I would remember even with dementia; my heart sank as I struggled to catch my breath. My hands trembled vehemently as I rushed to my phone to log onto Binance and check my account. And in that moment, I finally understood what true silence felt like. The silence where sound is still present, but you are so overwhelmed by emotion that all stimuli becomes numb to you. I just stood there, staring at the numbers in complete disbelief. $2300 it read. Down from a high of $200,000. After a few minutes of digesting the situation, I came to the realization that everything I had worked for, all those endless nights and days praying to retire early, were all in vain. And that was just the beginning of my death spiral. After learning about my failure, my wife deemed me financially irresponsible and told me she wanted a divorce. At first I thought she said it in the heat of the moment, but after being with someone for 9 years, you tend to know when they are serious. And if that wasn't enough to bare, she told me she's taking custody of the kids (which I plan to fight) and asking for the house in the settlement. In a matter of 24 hours, I literally lost everything I had worked so hard for in the past few years. All because of what? Some deviants that had no regard for others? I will admit, everytime I think about it or even see an article with TerraLuna or UST in its headline, a bit of me becomes enraged. Enraged because I feel so hopeless and know that nothing will happen to the people that caused all this pain and misery not only to myself, but so many others as well. Its not fucking fair. But then again, life is never fair. Which is why you should never take what you do have for granted, because it could all disappear in the blink of an eye. Literally.

Well it wasn’t, not at all. 

I’ve been steadily putting small change that I was able to “afford to lose” into Algo, Eth, Btc and Trac on Kucoin. Over the course of a year and half, it amounted to roughly 150 usd. Yesterday I saw TERRALUNA going from $10 and further down the hill so I, for the first time ever, decided to use KuCoins 3S coin. So in short a 3x short trading option. Everything went fine and slowly it got to value of roughly usd 250 and I was super excited. I could take the position and cash out and get kids something. It kept going down and my position gaining value…all until KuCoin decided to literally close my investment and block me from all withdrawal. Now Im stuck with their 31 L3S coins which are valued at a few cents…

As I’m not from US this might not sound like a big loss for a lot of people from first world countries but as an only parent who was building this portfolio for over a year…it really crushed me.

I’m posting this so that you don’t make the same mistake! KuCoin is a casino both in features and in getting your money back. They don’t care. And don’t even think of fiddling with their 3 short or long coins. These are literally scam and should be forbidden. I was always against regulations in crypto but stuff like this should be an offense.
