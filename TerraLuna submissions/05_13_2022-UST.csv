Do Kwon’s hubris has caught up with him, lapped him, and then kicked him into the dirt on its second time around. An algorithmic stable coin has never functioned perfectly, so Do Kwon’s cockiness about his tech makes this event not only juicy with thick red candles, but also in irony. He was quoted only a week ago making a joke about how 95% of coins will die but Luna/UST will stand tall. I can’t fathom the damage this did to the Lunatics’ finances and mental health—I hope the best for you all in the times to come.
This price action was so calamitous that it hurt more than just the average investor, as loads of influencers loyal to only Luna were left with nothing, and ‘professional’ traders who dumped millions of dollars into Luna the much of the way down were left with much of the same (I witnessed a $3m trade become $1000 in a day).
But now for the good…if you were paying attention this event presented a golden opportunity for (essentially) risk free profits. During Luna’s expedient downfall it amassed quite a large spread between exchanges. At one point you could buy Luna on Kraken and then sell it on ByBit moments later for a hefty 3x return. I know what you’re thinking ‘ahh they probably froze withdrawals/deposits with such a large spread and you could only manage one trade before the party was over’, but I’ll have you know I spent 7 hours doing this exact thing last night. I would have arbitraged all the way until I was the last degenerate present in the order books had Kraken not limited my withdrawals to $500k, but alas another arb opportunity shall surely arise.

I've been trying to figure out what to expect next and if ever would be a good time to invest in Terra.

What do you need to know -

* UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burn UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn't keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash.  Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST.
* Prior to the depeg there was a circulating supply of 18.6B UST. Currently there is a circulating supply of 11.9B UST. Meaning it only took 36% of the supply of UST to drop the price of Terra from $60 to .006. a 99.9999% drop. There is still 64% of the total UST that hasn't been removed/converted back to Luna. There is still a long.............. way Luna can fall.
* Why would someone convert UST back to Luna? Because UST is worth $.55 and it can be converted to $1 of Terra. No guarantee it will be worth that though by the time you get/sell it (you could even lose money trying assuming the price of Terra continues to drop)
* The [circulating supply of Luna](https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circ) is up  425% in the last three days and likely to increase further and significantly faster as the depeg remains off and money flows out of UST into Terra further exponentially increasing the supply and dropping the price of Terra.
* A lot more Terra is being minted for every UST now than yesterday. Yesterday for every $1 (true Dollar) of UST you'd about 1-2 Luna today that's 330 and it's going to continue to increase at a faster and faster rate as the price of Luna falls. This is the death spiral of Luna and why investors shouldn't think they're getting Luna for cheap.
* If the total marketcap of UST was lower maybe Luna could have survived this above $1 eventually people may have ran out of UST to burn for Luna and maybe you'd be ok buying it in case it ever recovered (this is likely part of why the last two depegs didn't crush Luna - the marketcap of Luna was still relatively low enough to weather the influx of UST burns.

Speculation. What isn't clear is will people stop buying Luna. I mean if you get 10,000 Luna for $1 are some people going to buy it in case it ever ""recovers?"". If so will the people buying be able to continue to support people in UST trying to get out of the asset, or will people stop buying UST as it adds another 10 decimal points (speculation) if so what happens to the money in UST - 11.9B stuck in UST became worthless if people aren't buying Luna? Eventually when this is all done with Luna have a future without UST?

\--------------

None of this speculation is entirely clear, but what is clear - is.. UST is suffocating Luna and it could potentially become worthless unless people continue to buy Luna despite the number of decimal points it's going to quickly start adding.

Last note UST has 11.9B stuck in and it's supported/can be exchanged for Luna which has a marketcap of roughly 16.6M-50M depending on the platform.

Final Final note - some of the numbers are not perfectly correlated in different sections because the price was fluctuating while I was writing this.

*  just put half of my portfolio on LUNA @ $0.90 
*  LUNA is so cheap at $1. Like yeah UST depegging is a problem but there are other usecases for LUNA besides just UST. 
*  Money to be made here lads, Luna bounces from 4 to 6 in the space of 5 mins. Just don't linger too long lol 
*  So everyone is fearfull and says Luna is dead. Time to get GREEDY BABY 
*  r/cc has the memory if a gold fish and the gambling habits of a 75 year old chain smoking slots grandma. Ust will repeg and everyone will act like this didn’t happen. I’m not saying it’s a good thing, i just know how this game is played. 
* People tink luna will go to zero,there is a shitload of bots buying it. It will not go to zero

I've been trying to figure out what to expect next and if ever would be a good time to invest in Terra.

What do you need to know -

* UST and Terra price are directly related - You can burn Terra and mint UST, or you can burt UST and mint Terra. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Terra ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Terra - increasing the supply of Terra. Since demand isn't keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Terra is continuing to crash.  Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Terra worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Terra for $1 (true dollar) of UST.
* Prior to the depeg there was a circulating supply of 18.6B UST. Currently there is a circulating supply of 11.9B UST. Meaning it only took 36% of the supply of UST to drop the price of Terra from $60 to .006. a 99.9999% drop. There is still 64% of the total UST that hasn't been removed/converted back to Terra. There is still a long.............. way Terra can fall.
* Why would someone convert UST back to Terra? Because UST is worth $.55 and it can be converted to $1 of Terra. No guarantee it will be worth that though by the time you get/sell it (you could even lose money trying assuming the price of Terra continues to drop)
* The [circulating supply of Terra](https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circ) is up  425% in the last three days and likely to increase further and significantly faster as the depeg remains off and money flows out of UST into Terra further exponentially increasing the supply and dropping the price of Terra.
* A lot more Terra is being minted for every UST now than yesterday. Yesterday for every $1 (true Dollar) of UST you'd about 1-2 Terra today that's 330 and it's going to continue to increase at a faster and faster rate as the price of Terra falls. This is the death spiral of Terra and why investors shouldn't think they're getting Terra for cheap.
* If the total marketcap of UST was lower maybe Terra could have survived this above $1 eventually people may have ran out of UST to burn for Terra and maybe you'd be ok buying it in case it ever recovered (this is likely part of why the last two depegs didn't crush Terra - the marketcap of UST was still relatively low enough that Terra was able to weather the influx of UST burns.

Speculation. What isn't clear is will people stop buying Terra. I mean if you get 10,000 Terra for $1 are some people going to buy it in case it ever ""recovers?"". If so will the people buying be able to continue to support people in UST trying to get out of the asset, or will people stop buying UST as it adds another 10 decimal points (speculation) if so what happens to the money in UST - 11.9B stuck in UST became worthless if people aren't buying Terra? Eventually when this is all done with Terra have a future without UST?

\--------------

None of this speculation is entirely clear, but what is clear - is.. UST is suffocating Terra and it could potentially become worthless unless people continue to buy Terra despite the number of decimal points it's going to quickly start adding.

Last note UST has 11.9B stuck in and it's supported/can be exchanged for Terra which has a marketcap of roughly 16.6M-50M depending on the platform.

Final Final note - some of the numbers are not perfectly correlated in different sections because the price was fluctuating while I was writing this.

No, i avoid it.

I was trying to hold on and hope for the repeg, but I think I've been a fool to do this...

I've frantically been trying to withdraw my UST to an exchange and sent a test transaction from TeraStation, but used all my TeraStation balance so now I don't have enough for tx fees to withdraw my full balance from Anchor...

I don't know what else to do apart from asking if someone could PLEASE send me like $0.50 UST for tx fees.. I tried buying on Binance and other exchanges but I either cannot withdraw or the 2FA is taking too long.

I can't bare to see it go to zero for $0.50 tx fees:

Basically the circulating supply is almost 20 billion and it keeps increasing. There is no max, except maybe the max size of the double value (which might have 300 zeros..)..

If I understood the process, while UST is under the peg (1 dollar), you need to produce 1 dollar of LUNA (however many luna that may need) and sell it. Since the UST cannot retain its peg (I guess due to a lot of people wanting to sell and exit due to market conditions), we are in this loop which keeps spiraling.

I am just watching this number grow and I am amazed..

so yeah we all know that UST has drastically de-pegged.

most people here believe that Citadel and Gemini or whoever did a coordinated attack to lower its value because they had loans in it (basically shorting it). Not like anyone cares to provide any sort of evidence for that because ""trust me bro"" is more than sufficient for that.

other people say that LUNA and its stablecoins were always a ponzi scheme or a rugpull or whichever other words the average redditor wrongly uses as a synonym for any sort of scam, fraud, flaw or loss of value to appear smarter than the Safemoon crowd.

in reality LUNA and UST are just massive failures due to a pretty significant flaw in the way UST was supposed to keep its peg. thing is its not backed by real USD and its also not overcollateralized, like DAI for example.

the way algorithmic stablecoins keep their value (or don't apparently) is that you can always burn them for $1 worth of LUNA. Not for any fixed amount of LUNA, but for whatever amount of LUNA currently has a value of $1.

this does have the advantage that you don't rely on a centralized company or on people that take risky DeFi loans to mint the stablecoin. But this completely collapses if too many people cash out at once.

See you only get 1 US dollar thru that algorithmic approach if you burn 1 UST for LUNA and then sell your LUNA. This is a problem because if LUNA is being sold it is losing value and if masses of people sell it at once it could lose its value faster than you can sell your $1 worth of LUNA for $1. And in that case UST is practically no longer backed by enough value.

Maybe there was an attack, maybe not. That a stablecoin loses its value at any exchange for a short period of time isn't a problem. That happens all the time, even if only rarely to more than one percent. But that the algorithm that gave UST its value is completely unable to let the UST holders cash out without eating each other alive always made it a ticking time bomb. There is no need for any sort of attack for UST to collapse, this was bound to happen at some point.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4833440,public,,self,The reason why UST failed is much simpler than you think.

No.

So I'm down, from the total fiat deposited over a span of about 18 months (sorta kinda DCA but more dips and rips) almost  -18% , 
not Time Weighted, 
and including profit taking. 
As in, yep underwater.
Compounded annually -12.3%

From ATH however, I'm down -44% , net change % from ATH to PV , not Time Weighted.  

So not only did I not properly lock in profits and take enough off the table, but I HODLed thru ""the Dip"" way too long before I accepted it was a trend reversal and we weren't going back up. Plus, the little run up in March trapped me like the bull I am. 

All in all, if I had never touched crypto (others) and put the fiat in a savings account instead, I would have, well, exactly what I started with, minus inflation.  Nuts.
(This is just crypto.  Add TradFi on to this and it's worse)

Still hold most of my BTC ETH and then whatever else I got stuck bag holding across probably 10 blockchains and 25 wallets. 

But oh the friends I didn't make! The memories I don't have! The recreation I didn't enjoy!  Makes it all so not worth it. lol.

 The cherry on top is that during 
"" PegaSus: The Terrabull Wreckoning ""

I wasn't even holding any UST or LUNA. t's all collateral damage bc they were linked to so many other coins like AVAX and ATOM. 

But I'm not here to talk shit. I'm not here to blame anyone but me. I'm here to hopefully make one person feel better that I did at least everything wrong and the reverse of strategic moves.  I def bought high and sold mad low during my journey.  And all I got was the knowledge of about 30 Ponzinomics white papers crammed in head.  

Anyway, feel free to contribute, or don't and just rag on me, it's all cool. Whatever might help you feel a bit better.  I hope y'all are doing ok considering, and some day in the not too distant future maybe we get a shot to do it all over again.  LFG!

To clarify up front - I'm not saying any eventuality will occur, just outlining the possibilities.

A lot of people are getting hung up on what I'll call the mathematics and there seems to be a narrative that even if LUNA's price falls into oblivion, UST must inevitably return to $1. To understand why this **may** not happen (nobody can say anything for sure) you have to understand the arbitrage process.

When you convert UST to LUNA, as you all probably know by now, you get the equivalent of $1 of LUNA back. This is calculated via an oracle which watches various LUNA-USD(equivalent) markets to actually tell the chain how much a LUNA is worth. Obviously this is where our first bit of uncertainty creeps in - how reliable are those oracles? Do they represent a price you can actually get or just a notional value? Hopefully somebody with more knowledge of them can fill in the actual details as I'm not an expert on the LUNA ecosystem.

So the first issue is - once you've burned your UST to mint LUNA, how much are you really going to be able to sell it for? If LUNA's price is volatile, clearly you're going to be taking some risk as these transactions aren't instant and the exchange price can shift before you can sell.

Second issue is related to the first but different, and potentially far more serious - Liquidity. If you could be sure you could find a buyer for your LUNA then yes, you could guarantee that at some point UST will return to peg as you could always sell your LUNA for something. But what if there are no LUNA buyers to be found? I think when people trade exclusively in large cap markets, they forget that small markets gap all the time. If buyers and sellers can't agree on a price, the market literally just stops until someone breaks the ceasefire. (I apologise for somewhat ignoring the DEX market here which functions more like a pool you can theoretically always transact with. In practice, I think most would-be arbitragers are probably targetting hard fiat right now rather than another 'stable' coin.)

So if we find ourselves in a situation where literally nobody wants to buy LUNA, then yes, chart goes to infinity, divide-by-zero error, UST ya done. Again **I'm not saying this will definitely happen** but the number of people who aren't aware of the possibility is scary.

Terra started a “stable coin” that isn’t a traditional stable coin.

They made it so that they are interchangeable, so you can trade 1 LUNA for 1 UST, and vice versa.

This made it so that people could basically print profits no matter what:

- Oh LUNA is $50? Okay, I’ll buy a shit ton of UST for $1 and trade it for a LUNA, sell, and repeat. Profit.

- Oh LUNA is $0.05? Okay, I’ll buy a shit ton of LUNA and trade it for UST at whatever price it is ($1+), sell, and repeat. Profit.

Now, to me, this seems like an unfixable problem and the only way it can be fixed is if they are both priced at $1, but even then the small changes will cause a massive ripple effect because everyone is doing the same thing.

I keep trying to understand this stuff, but all I see is conspiracy theories, some about the KuWon guy, some about Blackrock and whatever other company, some about a massive plan to rug pull, etc.

So what actually is going on?

Can LUNA ever recover?

I can’t see it recovering as long as UST is interchangeable with LUNA, right? Because the prices will always be screwed unless they are both $1.

Here's how you can profit from it.

**The situation**  
Trust into stablecoins is at an all-time low. The UST/Luna collapse showed many investors that stablecoins do bear a risk and that the huge rewards from staking are there for a reason. While stablecoins were used as a safe haven in previous crashes, it's safe to assume that people will now move to USD directly.

Tether has been known to lie about their reserves for years. All the time, it was obvious that the only thing that could trigger a collapse was a massive bankrun, something we might see in the near future.

**How you can profit**  
You can short the USD/USDT pair on Kraken for example. I would strongly advise against doing this on Bitfinex or FTX, as they will be able to manipulate prices there much easier - more on that later. The idea behind the trade is simple: If you short USD/USDT, you will make profit when USDT loses it's peg, but your possible loss is rather limited since USDT is not likely to go over 1$. So you have a potential 100% profit with a risk of (at the time of writing) a \~2% loss if it goes back up to 1$.

**So where's the kicker?**  
Obviously, Bitfinex is not very keen on seeing their business ended. They will do everything they can to keep USDT from collapsing - that includes playing dirty.  
They will likely attempt to do a shakeout - driving the price up to significantly above 1$ to cause a margin call on short orders, which can potentially trigger a cascading effect, closing most shorts. They'll have an easier time doing this on exchanges they control. This is why you definitely should not attempt this on FTX or Bitfinex - they'll have complete information on all triggerpoints for margin calls and can pull it off easily there.

**So what can you do?**  
Open the order on an reputable exchange that is rather independent from Bitfinex, like Kraken. Be sure to place a stop order at a bit above 1$ - if a shakeout happens, you don't want to be caught in it. Also, already set a closing order - the most extreme dip will likely be rather short before stabilizing a bit again, so having your order pulled off without your manual interaction is valuable. Also, make sure you don't run into a margin call because any of your other assets that provides the margin loses it's value.

My question is, since this is all happening on the blockchain(s) shouldn’t we be able to see exact contextual data of these transactions. All three parties denied involvement earlier today as well. 

Somebody or a couple organizations are definitely involved with tanking a top ten coin and also a stablecoin. It would be great to know who this person(s) are. I think we deserve to know. 

It breaks my heart to visit a couple Reddit crypto subs here and see people talk about how they lost their life savings.

Sure, you can. We are in a unregulated market.

It is highly likely this was a coordinated attack. OK, so how this works: UST is pegged to the USD, backed by two assets, Luna and BTC.

In March Luna foundation group (LFG) announced they are buying a ton of BTC, $10 billion of BTC, to be exact, to increase the backing of the UST. This is the time people know how much LFG has.

If you think that is a lot, it is. But there's always a bigger fish. According to the Onchain Wizard, someone (most likely Citadel) sold over a quarter of billion of UST on Binance and Curve. With God knows much OTC deals.

The system of backing has been basically exploited, taking into account we're facing a major bear run/crash/dump (whatever you want to call it). Basically, the attacker shorted a lot of BTC and UST, waited for LFG to sell it's BTC (lowering the BTC price slightly) to protect the peg, drained the Curve liquidity (with as low as $350 mill), which started the de-pegging (and the inevitable end scenario). LFG sells again, attacker starts selling his (OTC borrowed) UST on Binance, chain gets bloated, big exchanges start suspending withdrawals one by one, UST depegs further, and *voila...* Luna gets obliterated (**currently at $0.16, down 97% in 24hrs**), while UST is **currently at $0.64.** The exact price changes rapidly so take that into account when reading this.

I just feel bad for all the people that got burned badly by this. IT. TRULY. SUCKS. I had a small LP position in UST, which I considered as safe as possible, so I have that going for me... But it was next to nothing to what some people here lost.

I think it's safe to say Microstrategy is also not safe. There's always bigger players, with bad intentions, that can take you out just like that, considering crypto is a market that's peanuts (compared to futures), and with next to zero regulation.

looking into the Terra / Luna / UST ecosystem and I perceive some clear risks to the overall ecosystem in the current setup. The following risks seem unlikely, but the chance of them happening is above 0, thus can\'t be ignored. This includes a possible total loss of funds for Luna / UST holders.\n\nHere are some risks I perceive and I welcome inputs:\n\n**1. UST market cap vs Luna market cap ratio as a risk metric for UST holders**\n\nAs UST market cap increases, Luna\'s market cap should also go up as more Luna is burned = less Luna = price of Luna goes up. However, a flash crash on Luna (due to market conditions or otherwise) can lead to a scenario where Luna\'s market cap is LOWER than UST in circulation, especially if UST market cap increases exponentially. At that point the question is, what is backing the extra UST?\n\n* UST Market Cap today - $10.5 bil\n* Luna Market Cap today - $28 bil\n\nAs of today, if Luna crashes more than 65% or to around $29, then Luna\'s market cap will be under $10.5 bil UST in circulation. What happens then? The UST/USD peg is lost. This is exactly what happened on 23 May 2021. 1.6 bil Luna backed 2 bil UST. The peg was restored after interventions, i.e. someone (hint: Terraform Labs) bought Luna to increase its price and market cap back above UST market cap.\n\n[23 May 2021 - UST depeg event](https://preview.redd.it/a48ycpmkhab81.png?width=2545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11aa903b017f08023bb0dd2481d5098868d74073)\n\nCan this happen again, yes. The problem is that as the UST/Luna market cap increases, we can end up with a situation where if the ratio goes negative again, it won\'t be $400 mil that are backed by nothing, but billions. At that point, panic will be quite high. What can stop this? A few billion buy orders on Luna from Terraform Labs to restore the balance. Regardless, this remains a risk in my opinion.\n\nIf you hold Luna or UST, watching this ratio is crucial, since if it ends up flipping negative, you better get out before or wait for the peg to be restored after, provided Luna does not crash to 0. Either way, anyone that used leverage to borrow against UST may be liquidated before they can react like in May.\n\n**2. Anchor Protocol - deposit interest crashes from 20% due to lack of yield reserves**\n\nA lot of UST was created and is used to farm the 20% interest paid by Anchor for deposits. Anchor represents 50% or $9 bil of the total value locked on the Terra chain today which is basically leading the adoption of UST.\n\n[20&amp;#37; interest on Anchor](https://preview.redd.it/l6x78xq5iab81.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7637e7a2fecf53474a70ec2f51ee30d53650508a)\n\nRight now Anchor has $60 mil in its yield reserves to guarantee the 20% interest on deposits. This is falling quite quickly as shown below.\n\n[Anchor Yield Reserve - something has changed after steady growth](https://preview.redd.it/whm7g9fh0ab81.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8d3c56f58058e3515bc7e1b8493689454756437)\n\nWhy is the yield reserve crashing? Because there are more deposits getting interest vs borrowers paying it. Worse yet, Abracadabra and other protocols farm this 20% yield and compound UST deposits to drain it faster!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Anchor deposit vs borrow](https://preview.redd.it/63vzko6whab81.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8afd2ab6bdc6f70d806f1ed5054b0c2c5306b57e)\n\nSo where is the risk? As soon as the 20% interest cannot be paid anymore, the interest % will be reduced to whatever is sustainable. However, suddenly, the 5.5 bil UST on Anchor deposits may want to leave Terra ecosystem to find better opportunities. What happens when UST market cap is reduced? More Luna is released into circulation. Luna price goes down, people that borrowed UST with Luna get liquidated. The whole process is reversed. What goes up, now goes down. Can this trigger a systemic risk as indicated under point 1? Possibly.\n\nWhat can save this? Terraform Labs injects fresh capital into the Anchor yield reserve (sounds familiar?). They did it before in July 2021.\n\n[Fresh capital from TFL](https://preview.redd.it/esfyzjh1iab81.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc23390c06f11569a2752ca9c0ec423cbebd439)\n\nBut this will only make things worse long term because as the Terra ecosystem grows on ""credit"" the systemic risk also increases as we\'re now talking billions not millions. So when the music stops, who will back the yield? No one and people rush to liquidate their UST/Luna.\n\n[UST Market Cap](https://preview.redd.it/xis5cpskiab81.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=160c50fc68523d2ae77318783fe65c9d29a930cb)\n\nObviously this can also be a slow process with the interest % falling lower over time and finding a balance. Plus there are capital controls so you can\'t really mint/burn UST 1 bil / day. But, everything is done to POSTPONE the market from finding an equilibrium between deposits/borrowers and when the rug is pulled, it may get ugly, fast. The peg can be lost again, people get liquidated, billions are lost. Who will buy Luna then if they risk losing their money?\n\n**3. Luna price goes to near 0.**\n\nThis is highly unlikely, but would basically make UST worthless and the whole ecosystem crashes. Likely it would not recover. While this risk is low, it can\'t be excluded can it? There is nothing else backing UST but Luna. What backs Luna? Trust in the Terra ecosystem?\n\nThe risk to me is the fact that at KEY points when UST lost its peg, Terraform Labs stepped in as a ""lender/buyer of last resort"". For example when the peg was lost in May 2021, Terraform Labs bought Luna, increasing its price/market cap. When Anchor was in trouble to pay the 20% interest Terraform Labs toped it off with $70 mil. At one point they will not be able to ""control"" the market from finding an equilibrium. Particularly if the ecosystem grows beyond their means of controlling divergences. That is when the crash takes place. Can they control it then?\n\nAnyone trying to control prices or the market will eventually fail. This is demonstrated by 5,000 years of recorded history. The more you distort prices artificially, the larger the eventual ""correction"". It would be best if Anchor finds a fair interest rate for its depositors rather than ""crediting"" it to keep it at 20%. At one point the money will run out and it will be painful to find equilibrium then.\n\n**4. Yield vampires - a risk created by the artificially high 20% interest on Anchor**\n\nAs indicated under point 2, the 20% interest paid by Anchor to depositors has led to other protocols (call them ""vampires"") dumping a lot of UST into Anchor to farm the yield and suck the money out of Anchor\'s yield reserve as fast as possible. This is done by creating more UST and compounding it several time with leverage.\n\n[Borrowing against UST... to deposit more UST in Anchor!](https://preview.redd.it/3v59dotkjab81.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=452034b71905d166b0b2c464b58c0837930730ea)\n\nBasically, market participants are doing a form of arbitrage here, whereby they will milk this free cash dry until there is none left and move on to the next opportunity. How long can Anchor/Terraform Labs allow this before it is a risk to them? The market will always seek equilibrium and this 20% interest is an artificial distortion, it will not last!\n\nWhy is it allowed to continue? It boosts the UST supply and ""adoption"", Luna price goes up... But it comes at a price, obviously. The hope is that Anchor can onboard more borrowers with attractive payouts (borrow and receive money!) to cover for the deposits, but this is misleading as the vampires will only increase, usually faster and liquidate the yield reserve. Anchor and the Terraform Labs appear to ""buy"" time (literally) and hope that after x amount of time, everything will be ok = market finds equilibrium.\n\nWhat if that does not happen and the music suddenly stops with your pants down? The longer they distort the market the worse it gets. Perhaps demand to borrow an additional $10 bil in the current market is simply not there... Anchor is encouraging people to borrow by giving them handouts! In any case, my point is, the crash will get worse the longer this goes, triggering other systemic risks as indicated above.\n\n\\---\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nTerra / Luna / UST growth is subsidized by incentives. As soon as these stop or are reduced for various reasons the growth we\'ve seen can be reversed, both in scale and speed as indicated by the underlying protocol. When this happens, the resilience of the system is put at risk and could uncover potential risks that are not so obvious during a bullish market. When taking that into account, owning UST as a ""stablecoin"" becomes much more risky than it initially appears. This risk is compounded as Terra ecosystem grows due to said ""incentives"". The crash will be harder when they stop.\n\nNevertheless, UST/Luna ecosystem has a sound mechanism to maintain the peg, despite any turbulences. Holders of UST should expect UST to lose its peg in the future again (this appears likely) and only if Luna crashes to near 0 (which is unlikely), would UST holder lose all their money. Those borrowing against UST would most likely be liquidated at some point in the future during a depeg event, even if brief.\n\nIn this context, would you hold UST?\n\nNFA / DYOR.

Anchor Protocol - deposit interest crashes from 20% due to lack of yield reserves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of UST was created and is used to farm the 20% interest paid by Anchor for deposits. Anchor represents 50% or $9 bil of the total value locked on the Terra chain today which is basically leading the adoption of UST.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/l6x78xq5iab81.png?width=551&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7637e7a2fecf53474a70ec2f51ee30d53650508a""&gt;20&amp;#37; interest on Anchor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now Anchor has $60 mil in its yield reserves to guarantee the 20% interest on deposits. This is falling quite quickly as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/whm7g9fh0ab81.png?width=1270&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e8d3c56f58058e3515bc7e1b8493689454756437""&gt;Anchor Yield Reserve - something has changed after steady growth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is the yield reserve crashing? Because there are more deposits getting interest vs borrowers paying it. Worse yet, Abracadabra and other protocols farm this 20% yield and compound UST deposits to drain it faster!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/63vzko6whab81.png?width=854&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8afd2ab6bdc6f70d806f1ed5054b0c2c5306b57e""&gt;Anchor deposit vs borrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So where is the risk? As soon as the 20% interest cannot be paid anymore, the interest % will be reduced to whatever is sustainable. However, suddenly, the 5.5 bil UST on Anchor deposits may want to leave Terra ecosystem to find better opportunities. What happens when UST market cap is reduced? More Luna is released into circulation. Luna price goes down, people that borrowed UST with Luna get liquidated. The whole process is reversed. What goes up, now goes down. Can this trigger a systemic risk as indicated under point 1? Possibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can save this? Terraform Labs injects fresh capital into the Anchor yield reserve (sounds familiar?). They did it before in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/esfyzjh1iab81.png?width=1353&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ffc23390c06f11569a2752ca9c0ec423cbebd439""&gt;Fresh capital from TFL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this will only make things worse long term because as the Terra ecosystem grows on &amp;quot;credit&amp;quot; the systemic risk also increases as we&amp;#39;re now talking billions not millions. So when the music stops, who will back the yield? No one and people rush to liquidate their UST/Luna.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/xis5cpskiab81.png?width=1222&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=160c50fc68523d2ae77318783fe65c9d29a930cb""&gt;UST Market Cap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously this can also be a slow process with the interest % falling lower over time and finding a balance. Plus there are capital controls so you can&amp;#39;t really mint/burn UST 1 bil / day. But, everything is done to POSTPONE the market from finding an equilibrium between deposits/borrowers and when the rug is pulled, it may get ugly, fast. The peg can be lost again, people get liquidated, billions are lost. Who will buy Luna then if they risk losing their money?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Luna price goes to near 0.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is highly unlikely, but would basically make UST worthless and the whole ecosystem crashes. Likely it would not recover. While this risk is low, it can&amp;#39;t be excluded can it? There is nothing else backing UST but Luna. What backs Luna? Trust in the Terra ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The risk to me is the fact that at KEY points when UST lost its peg, Terraform Labs stepped in as a &amp;quot;lender/buyer of last resort&amp;quot;. For example when the peg was lost in May 2021, Terraform Labs bought Luna, increasing its price/market cap. When Anchor was in trouble to pay the 20% interest Terraform Labs toped it off with $70 mil. At one point they will not be able to &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; the market from finding an equilibrium. Particularly if the ecosystem grows beyond their means of controlling divergences. That is when the crash takes place. Can they control it then?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone trying to control prices or the market will eventually fail. This is demonstrated by 5,000 years of recorded history. The more you distort prices artificially, the larger the eventual &amp;quot;correction&amp;quot;. It would be best if Anchor finds a fair interest rate for its depositors rather than &amp;quot;crediting&amp;quot; it to keep it at 20%. At one point the money will run out and it will be painful to find equilibrium then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Yield vampires - a risk created by the artificially high 20% interest on Anchor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As indicated under point 2, the 20% interest paid by Anchor to depositors has led to other protocols (call them &amp;quot;vampires&amp;quot;) dumping a lot of UST into Anchor to farm the yield and suck the money out of Anchor&amp;#39;s yield reserve as fast as possible. This is done by creating more UST and compounding it several time with leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/3v59dotkjab81.png?width=585&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=452034b71905d166b0b2c464b58c0837930730ea""&gt;Borrowing against UST... to deposit more UST in Anchor!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, market participants are doing a form of arbitrage here, whereby they will milk this free cash dry until there is none left and move on to the next opportunity. How long can Anchor/Terraform Labs allow this before it is a risk to them? The market will always seek equilibrium and this 20% interest is an artificial distortion, it will not last!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it allowed to continue? It boosts the UST supply and &amp;quot;adoption&amp;quot;, Luna price goes up... But it comes at a price, obviously. The hope is that Anchor can onboard more borrowers with attractive payouts (borrow and receive money!) to cover for the deposits, but this is misleading as the vampires will only increase, usually faster and liquidate the yield reserve. Anchor and the Terraform Labs appear to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; time (literally) and hope that after x amount of time, everything will be ok = market finds equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if that does not happen and the music suddenly stops with your pants down? The longer they distort the market the worse it gets. Perhaps demand to borrow an additional $10 bil in the current market is simply not there... Anchor is encouraging people to borrow by giving them handouts! In any case, my point is, the crash will get worse the longer this goes, triggering other systemic risks as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terra / Luna / UST growth is subsidized by incentives. As soon as these stop or are reduced for various reasons the growth we&amp;#39;ve seen can be reversed, both in scale and speed as indicated by the underlying protocol. When this happens, the resilience of the system is put at risk and could uncover potential risks that are not so obvious during a bullish market. When taking that into account, owning UST as a &amp;quot;stablecoin&amp;quot; becomes much more risky than it initially appears. This risk is compounded as Terra ecosystem grows due to said &amp;quot;incentives&amp;quot;. The crash will be harder when they stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, UST/Luna ecosystem has a sound mechanism to maintain the peg, despite any turbulences. Holders of UST should expect UST to lose its peg in the future again (this appears likely) and only if Luna crashes to near 0 (which is unlikely), would UST holder lose all their money. Those borrowing against UST would most likely be liquidated at some point in the future during a depeg event, even if brief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this context, would you hold UST?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NFA / DYOR.

I honestly don't believe that it'll end up like UST considering the fact that USDT has been around for ages and is one of the largest and most used stablecoins. It took it almost a month to repeg and I can envision such a scenario happening here.

In the short term, it'll probably struggle to repeg, probably trading around the 0.95+s range or maybe 0.85+s depending on how much its going to crash this time but in a few months it should be back to 1.

UST completely de-pegged and Luna basically said a big “fuck y’all” and collapsed of 90%+. It just shows that truly no crypto is safe at this point. So what does that leave politicians to want to do?

It seems USDT is breaking its peg

It currently sits at 97 cents, only 3% but massive for a supposed stablecoin

After all the talk of it being a big Ponzi scheme , no real audits and a bunch of funny money propping the crypto market ready to drop; is this it?



I do wonder if this is gonna be a bigger drop off for usdt or the market in general, as I haven’t seen it do this before. If it does we are all in for a massive bloodbath.

UST dropping could of been the trigger, as investors find stable coins to be shaky and try to redeem their USDT and its causing this drop, or/as well it could be because the whole markets crashing and liquidity is running out, but maybe it’s something else, thoughts?",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4831546,public,new,self,It seems USDT is losing its peg,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/unv0ac/it_seems_usdt_is_losing_its_peg/,all_ads,6,1652309506.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True

That means if LUNA even goes to $25 it will have the highest market cap it ever has achieved. Simply put, it’s not magically going to go back even to $20 let alone $100. A lot of people have already burned trying to catch the falling knife from yesterday.

While it sucks to see our positions slide I think we should not focus the blame onto the parties who made this attack but those who created the mechanics and allowed this to happen. No doubht others saw the opportunity but didn't have the capital to act.

The attack was only possible because of the mechanics of UST/Luna and the lack of collateral to match the value of UST in existence. Questions have been asked and fingers pointed in the past and it turned out they were mostly true.

Disclaimer: I have no vested stake or interest in LUNA, just trying to learn from an event like this as it's the first catastrophic market event I've witnessed in my time trading/investing.

Firstly, condolences to those severely impacted by this. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. In light of this however, is there any hope for those that have gone down with heavy bags of LUNA, or even UST for that matter? Or has the ship truely sunk in this instance?

Whilst I've done some reading over the social space, I'm still a unclear on 4 main questions that keep popping up for me: 

1. Was this foul play from the team at LUNA or a hostile move from competition/shortened? 

2. What essentially went wrong to cause this?  

3. This may be a redundant question given question 2, but what could I take away from this that would signal alarm bells? What are the tell tale signs that something is amiss?

4. What possible actions (if any) may be taken to see LUNA recover from an event like this? Do the holders stand a chance, or is there an opportunity for people to place long positions given its value rn?

Sorry if this post basically screams, ""do the work then spell it out for me!"". I don't clearly understand what has really taken place and if it's one thing I've taken out of the crypto space thus far is learn from everything - the wins and the losses. If this can help prevent others and myself from being caught in something like this, then all the merrier.

The comments come on the back of rapidly spreading rumors the financial giants had jointly borrowed 100,000 [**bitcoin**](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bitcoin/) (worth about $3 billion at today’s price) from cryptocurrency exchange Gemini to purchase [**UST**](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/terrausd/), only to dump the assets causing the market to collapse and wiping out more than $25 billion in the underlying LUNA market value.

Following on a tweet from Gemini posted earlier today, which denied making a 100,000 bitcoin loan to any large institutional counterparties, a Citadel source familiar with the allegations confirmed the company “does not trade stablecoins, including UST.” BlackRock went even further.

“Rumors that BlackRock had a role in the collapse of UST are categorically false,” said BlackRock spokesperson Logan Koffler. “In fact, BlackRock does not trade UST.”

The rumor mill started two days ago when a tweet with a similar message, though notably absent any mention of BlackRock, was retweeted more than a thousand times. At the moment, *Forbes* has not identified credible evidence to support the claims.

The rumors seem to have gained traction thanks in no small part to both firms’ recent entrance into crypto.

In January, Citadel accepted a $1.15 billion investment from traditional VC firm Sequoia Capital and crypto venture giant Paradigm, which wants to use the firm’s technology to bring credibility to crypto markets, according to a statement. Last year, billionaire Citadel CEO Ken Griffin earned the ire of many cryptophiles when he outbid a group of 17,000 crypto investors to purchase an original copy of the U.S. Constitution.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4830221,public,new,self,BlackRock And Citadel Deny Trading Cratering Stablecoin,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/unqpf4/blackrock_and_citadel_deny_trading_cratering/,all_ads,6,1652294344.0,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '__GucK9_oPkEyV8rAXRv8M7D9Kb4dvOlkaIl40cDlco', 'resolutions': [{'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NPVnVq_NenbVteD6CsyHH7BBQ9kCb7_wbPVEWaVR4nI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb83a598412bec97e4ca7fa08efae68760ba7970', 'width': 108}, {'height': 216, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NPVnVq_NenbVteD6CsyHH7BBQ9kCb7_wbPVEWaVR4nI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db1eca19af9bdf18f98fec6ca2e268e8a7f3723f', 'width': 216}], 'source': {'height': 250, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/NPVnVq_NenbVteD6CsyHH7BBQ9kCb7_wbPVEWaVR4nI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1f92e504664eec7df8d0607bb7aa894080cc1b0f', 'width': 250}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

Quick thoughts on the market.

BTC has been printing a Head and Shoulders pattern since the last time we visited this area. It just hit the $27,500 level of the Right Shoulder... If that trendline breaks below $26K we could see some serious downside. Ideally we see at least a relief bounce, with some helpful news and economic support. Anything above $33,500 invalidates this and we have a nice V bottom recovery.

If we break down below the green shaded area, we could see a market breakdown unlike anything we've experienced before. All previous patterns for BTC over the last 12 years would be out the window and we would be essentially starting from scratch.

For those not familiar, Head and Shoulders pattern is a very strong continuation pattern that has played out many times in BTC history.

Remember, it is a marathon, not a sprint...

In fact, I invested in Luna myself (a relatively small amount) and I must say I'm disgusted with myself for doing it. I invested pretty much because of the hype and I prertt much thought ""There's no way a coin with such a solid following can be garbage"". 


So in the last dew days I started to really take a deep dive into how Luna's algorithm actually worked. I'm a dev, so perhaps I can see flaws some others can't, but man ... Their algorithm was so OBVIOUSLY trash. How did we, as a community, ever supported such shitty concept? Was it strictly because of the supposed 20% APY? 

I mean, sure hindsight is 2022, but it was so obvious the algorithm was garbage ... It's not a subtle flaw or anything, it's right there for eveyone to see. 

I guess this will serve as a major lesson for many of us ... No one knows shit about fucks and most importantly ...

Hope everyone is staying safe. If not, talk to someone - it will get better. 

I wrote the attached deep-dive into the entire debacle. If anyone has thoughts, feedback or disagreements, I would love to hear them. 


If you're confused at the complex moving parts here, it may help, I've tried to explain everything in a concise and simple manner. 

•How did it happen?
•Was it an attack?
•What fatal flaws did @stablekwon miss?
•Contagion ahead?

The implications for the cryptocurrency market at large could be big here, as cascading liquidations and contagion will show up somewhere - you can't have an $18 billion stablecoin disappear or a $42 billion asset (Luna) do the same, without expecting fallout elsewhere - VC funds, startups, custodial lenders all could have been using anchor. 

Anyway, article attached.

As we all know luna can start going up when UST reaches peg. Problem is everyone is incentivised to buy ust and burn for luna. 

Possible solution. Make the APY on staking UST an amount so absurd you'd be crazy not to stake it. I'm talking maybe a limited time lock up staking mechanism which would lock up your UST, and in exchange you be granted like 10-20% APY in luna tokens.

I think this because if you haven't sold at this point you're either gonna hold, or you're not the brightest for selling at almost 100% loss. The fact remains that Luna is still a top 50 coin despite dropping 97% and UST is still a top 15 coin despite de-pegging. 


This tells me there's a very large a mount of incredibly stubborn (and in my opinion, smart) holders who aren't willing to part with their holdings at an extreme loss. Because frankly why sell at 97% down? 


Eventually UST will re-peg, and sure there will be a sell-off, but I think this is overalls going to ease fear and change the general sentiment of Luna, the people who really wanted out, likely already got out.

100,000 in UST in Anchor Earn

If you do nothing and it all goes to zero, then you lose all 100K.

Option B: LUNA trading at around $1 USD now but bouncing between 1-2 Move to Terra Station; Swap UST to LUNA; Assume it swaps at a px of 1.40; giving you about 70,000 LUNA; So you lose 30% and move on...normally you would lose much less but because the 1to1 parity is not there and there is large spread, you settle with the loss.

Option C: LUNA trading at around $1 USD now but bouncing between 1-2 Move to Terra Station; Swap UST to LUNA; Assume it swaps at a px of 1.40; giving you about 70,000 LUNA; But then you can move 70K LUNA to CDC for no fee. And if LUNA goes back up to just $2 USD, then you've doubled your position and it is $140K or a 40% return off your original 100K UST.

Over the short-term, this may be bad news and send shockwaves across the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.  


I've traded through multiple markets, and the crypto markets don't seem to have capitulated just yet. The key level in BTC to watch is $20K, and it wouldn't be crazy if it got there within the next week or two. If that $20K level can't hold, there may be massive selling down to $10K. A weak Bitcoin can cause the altcoins to drop, which they've been doing already.  


With Ethereum, that $1500 level is key, and with scalability issues still coming about and NFTs crashing — it can potentially get there.   


The shakeup in UST may cause more regulations for stablecoins, and that can damage the entire crypto market. There have been forced liquidations in the derivatives for Terra, and you can decide to buy the dip if you want, but I'm going to remain patient because I think we might be headed much lower.  


HODLing only works if you have a lot of cash and can continue to buy dips, but if you're all in - you might be in for a rude awakening. This is an actual bear market, and it could get worse for the next year or two.

The moment we stop thinking that it's inherent value is less than $1 as it has nothing to back it's value, it WILL have no value.

Hypothetically, even if all collectively switch to another stablecoin, say BUSD, USDT will still hold it's value because the big players won't let it go below $1. It is just like the fiat money we have. Each dollar bill has value because the big institutions over time have made us believe in it and adopt it so deeply in our system that it has become an indispensable part of our society and we collectively assign value to a piece of paper.


Now you might ask UST failed, what's stopping USDT from failing too. UST as a project didn't fail itself. It was a coordinated attack by an attacker who overtime accumulated large sums of BTC for a $4.2 billion short position and $1 billion in UST. He started dumping UST in large quantities in the market. Now this slowly start to make it lose it's peg. Now to hold it's peg LFG started dumping the bitcoin which was used to back it, to maintain it's $1 peg which resulted in more BTC downward momentum. The Luna foundation weren't able to make UST hold it's peg by selling the bitcoin. Now retail started panicking and pulling liquidity out and dumping it even more which eventually made UST lose it's peg.

Now you may ask, what's stopping people from dumping USDT. Nothing. People can dump their USDT in the market, or buy it a lot but it still won't lose it's value. It can be burned or minted at an infinite rate to keep pace with the demand. It has no assets backing it, so the price fluctuations of the underlying asset won't affect it's value and it's parent company won't need to dump an asset to make it hold it's value. They just mint more or burn more to keep it's price at $1.

but the alts I’m not sure what I should stick with, given that most of them won’t return to their all time highs. 

I’m leaning towards: 
Algo
Matic
ADA

ONE
APE because maybe it will be used in the future?

I feel bad for all the two sides (UST hodlers and Luna ones), but as fair as i noticed this could be the only way to getting the ust to peg usd againg and therefore we can have more space for Luna to regain in value.

Even in this rough market i think we should take time to think and even if the Luna team didnt proceed well we still have people losing their life savings in a completly scheme of manipulation. This is not a question about high APY's, Anchor is nothing to do in this case.

We've all seen the article and I'll post a link below but heres my view. and yes I am COMPLETELY biased thinking this is a BIG BROTHER banking type move to make money.

The article
news. bitcoin .com/stablecoin-implosion-luna-and-ust-lose-significant-value-downturn-ripples-across-the-crypto-economy/


My thoughts:
Personally I thin it's a ploy to drive the drive extremely low while gaining massive popularity with this token. I think the ""devil is in the details"" of this article. It was said I think in the second paragraph.

""First, we endorse the community proposal 1164 to Increase basepool from 50M to 100M SDR *) Decrease PoolRecoveryBlock from 36 to 18 This will increase minting capacity from $293M to ~$1200M,” the Terra co-founder added.""

If course u want to mint more to sell more but the more u have minted without active investors per coin or share, then the total minted becomes worth-less. That is until ""the troubles"" are resolved and the price has room to increase.

As noted in the article, Keon and other major players at the top already have large reserves but at that point they had reserves of a limited supply of a commodity.

Business rule 101:
Create so.ething that everyone wants as long as u have control of its value. If you cant co trolls the value, then create an intrest.
If you cant create intrest, then scare the ppl who own it into thinking itll be worth more.
But if everyone already has one, then you'll need to create more to gain more investors because ur current investors are maxed out.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4827312,public,new,self,$Luna down.

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1524123935570382851.html

UST is / was pegged by an algorithm . Not directly. Meaning that a list of diverse tokens were used to back its price, including BTC. If UST ever drops under 1 $ LFG (Luna Foundation Guard) uses its reserve to buy UST until it goes back to peg.

LFG made a huge position on BTC in order to back the UST peg.

A almost all the UST liquidity was on a single liquidity pool (4pool on curve), a liquidity pool constantly balances all 4 assets (usdc, udst etc)

A huge player noticed that dropping UST was relatively easy compared to dropping BTC price, and triggered LFG (Luna Foundation Guard) to sell btc and luna to buy UST immediataly when its price drops (they had 4.2 billion in BTC remember?) in order to maintain the UST peg.

The player started selling about 1bi in UST, the only big liquidity pool were getting full of UST and needed to balance to the others pairs (USDC,USDT).

In order to keep pool balance, the exceeding UST is sold at market and traded at other stablecoins, dropping the UST price every minute relatvely cheap.

The pool dumping UST and the attacker dumping 1 bi in UST drops the peg under 1$ every minute, LFG starts to basically sell at market BTC and LUNA to UST to keep the UST Peg.

FDIC &amp; SIPC were essential for financial stability &amp; to remove the fear of **""bank runs**"", but they should have been in place the whole time.

A crypto version of FDIC would have prevented even UST bank run that's still on going.

There's literally nothing protecting us from a crypto brokerage from going bankrupt; **your funds are not SAFU**.  The funds that Binance, bitmex, etc setup to protect users from hacks are nothing compared to an entire crypto broker going bankrupt, and **you're not going to get your funds back unless you have your coins in your own wallet.**

But obviously funds in your own wallet come with risks &amp; disadvantages:  Sure it's the safest to buy &amp; hold, but if someone gets your keys then your coins are gone.  Also you need to stake to take advantage of DeFi whether that's in a smart contract or a centralized broker, but that's still comes with risks:  Smart contract can have bugs / get hacked &amp; that bankruptcy risk again for centralized defi.

We need crypto regulation to protect consumers, to set rules, and with that will come insurances, imagine a FDIC for crypto, but that will never exist without regulation.
