I've been trying to figure out what to expect next and if ever would be a good time to invest in Terra.

What do you need to know -

* UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burn UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn't keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash.  Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST.
* Prior to the depeg there was a circulating supply of 18.6B UST. Currently there is a circulating supply of 11.9B UST. Meaning it only took 36% of the supply of UST to drop the price of Terra from $60 to .006. a 99.9999% drop. There is still 64% of the total UST that hasn't been removed/converted back to Luna. There is still a long.............. way Luna can fall.
* Why would someone convert UST back to Luna? Because UST is worth $.55 and it can be converted to $1 of Terra. No guarantee it will be worth that though by the time you get/sell it (you could even lose money trying assuming the price of Terra continues to drop)
* The [circulating supply of Luna](https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circ) is up  425% in the last three days and likely to increase further and significantly faster as the depeg remains off and money flows out of UST into Terra further exponentially increasing the supply and dropping the price of Terra.
* A lot more Terra is being minted for every UST now than yesterday. Yesterday for every $1 (true Dollar) of UST you'd about 1-2 Luna today that's 330 and it's going to continue to increase at a faster and faster rate as the price of Luna falls. This is the death spiral of Luna and why investors shouldn't think they're getting Luna for cheap.
* If the total marketcap of UST was lower maybe Luna could have survived this above $1 eventually people may have ran out of UST to burn for Luna and maybe you'd be ok buying it in case it ever recovered (this is likely part of why the last two depegs didn't crush Luna - the marketcap of Luna was still relatively low enough to weather the influx of UST burns.

Speculation. What isn't clear is will people stop buying Luna. I mean if you get 10,000 Luna for $1 are some people going to buy it in case it ever ""recovers?"". If so will the people buying be able to continue to support people in UST trying to get out of the asset, or will people stop buying UST as it adds another 10 decimal points (speculation) if so what happens to the money in UST - 11.9B stuck in UST became worthless if people aren't buying Luna? Eventually when this is all done with Luna have a future without UST?

\--------------

None of this speculation is entirely clear, but what is clear - is.. UST is suffocating Luna and it could potentially become worthless unless people continue to buy Luna despite the number of decimal points it's going to quickly start adding.

Last note UST has 11.9B stuck in and it's supported/can be exchanged for Luna which has a marketcap of roughly 16.6M-50M depending on the platform.

Final Final note - some of the numbers are not perfectly correlated in different sections because the price was fluctuating while I was writing this.

They panic and sell everything in hopes of saving what's left of their money. You can literally sense the fear and depression on some of these posts.

&amp;#x200B;

""That's it everyone, I lost my entire life savings, there is no hope""

""Why are you still investing? It won't be going up this time.""

""Whole Crypto system is a mess and we're being manipulated.""

""I quit. This is a ponzi scheme and you should wake up!""

""Crypto is such a scam and we all fell for it, fuck you whales""

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, there are long term investors, the people who outlived the previous bear markets. They know the game they're in, they know those days'll eventually pass and they keep DCA until the next cycle.  And yeah, this is usually the best thing to do in a bear market. Try to stay away most of the alts, DCA and don't stress about the daily charts. While it's not guaranteed that the BTC will eventually go up and reach a new ATH, it happened every time in the past and most likely will happen again. I don't know if Cryptocurrencies will be a thing for centuries but I believe we'll be keep using them in the near future and that's why I'm hodling.

&amp;#x200B;

But how do you know if the crypto market is literally dying and there won't be another cycle ever again? How do you know that was the last ATH and there is no hope of coming back anymore? Some people didn't understand the Terra ecosystem and bought the ""dip"" yesterday, only to lose their money within hours. Are you going to buy and HODL Bitcoin until it reaches to 0? I know we're not near the final but what would be the point of no return?

Final Final note - some of the numbers are not perfectly correlated in different sections because the price was fluctuating while I was writing this.

I've been trying to figure out what to expect next and if ever would be a good time to invest in Terra. 

What do you need to know - 

* UST and Luna price are directly related - You can burn Luna and mint UST, or you can burt UST and mint Luna. On May 8th (not including any fees you could burn about 60 UST ($60) to get 1 Luna ($60) - when UST started depegging people became financially incentivized to burn UST and convert it to Luna - increasing the supply of Luna. Since demand isn't keeping up with the increased supply - the price of Luna is continuing to crash.  Currently with 1 UST worth $.55 and 1 Luna worth $.0058 (not including fees you can mint 330.57 Luna for $1 (true dollar) of UST. 
* Prior to the depeg there was a circulating supply of 18.6B UST. Currently there is a circulating supply of 11.9B UST. Meaning it only took 36% of the supply of UST to drop the price of Terra from $60 to .006. a 99.9999% drop. There is still 64% of the total UST that hasn't been removed/converted back to Luna. There is still a long.............. way Luna can fall. 
* Why would someone convert UST back to Luna? Because UST is worth $.55 and it can be converted to $1 of Terra. No guarantee it will be worth that though by the time you get/sell it (you could even lose money trying assuming the price of Terra continues to drop)
* The [circulating supply of Luna](https://messari.io/asset/terra/chart/sply-circ) is up  425% in the last three days and likely to increase further and significantly faster as the depeg remains off and money flows out of UST into Terra further exponentially increasing the supply and dropping the price of Terra. 
* A lot more Terra is being minted for every UST now than yesterday. Yesterday for every $1 (true Dollar) of UST you'd about 1-2 Luna today that's 330 and it's going to continue to increase at a faster and faster rate as the price of Luna falls. This is the death spiral of Luna and why investors shouldn't think they're getting Luna for cheap. 
* If the total marketcap of UST was lower maybe Luna could have survived this above $1 eventually people may have ran out of UST to burn for Luna and maybe you'd be ok buying it in case it ever recoverered (this is likely part of why the last two depegs didn't crush Luna - the marketcap of Luna was still relatively low enough to weather the influx of UST burns.

Speculation. What isn't clear is will people stop buying Luna. I mean if you get 10,000 Luna for $1 are some people going to buy it in case it ever ""recovers?"". If so will the people buying be able to continue to support people in UST trying to get out of the asset, or will people stop buying UST as it adds another 10 decimal points (speculation) if so what happens to the money in UST - 11.9B stuck in UST became worthless if people aren't buying Luna? Eventually when this is all done with Luna have a future without UST?

\--------------

None of this speculation is entirely clear, but what is clear - is.. UST is suffocating Luna and it could potentially become worthless unless people continue to buy Luna despite the number of decimal points it's going to quickly start adding. 

Last note UST has 11.9B stuck in and it's supported/can be exchanged for Luna which has a marketcap of roughly 16.6M-50M depending on the platform.

There is a decentralised crypto called Axia  [https://axia.global/](https://axia.global/) that  seem to have a really great project on the go. The project ranges from  Axia Capital bank ,Debit card, Axia Browser, VPN , hyper deflation token burning all the way to mobile based staking and many more. The token is supposably backed by intrinsic value like companies and physical assets. 

The token was trading at the time of their price halving at around $13. 

The question i have is how sustainable is this token having them offer an APY of 192% for 2 years. What happens if there is a similar situation to Luna/Terra. Say a few or even one individual stakes a large amount of money for 2 years and decides to pull put. If the APY is so high would this not kill the market and cause a crash?

Let me know your thoughts on how sustainable a 192%  APY is?  [https://axia.global/axia-coin](https://axia.global/axia-coin)

issues to consider:

- LUNA in its’ current state is rendered completely pointless now considering the code for UST is changing to make it collateralised

- talks of the introduction of common global crypto regulation as soon as this year could hit the project hard in its current state

- another major issue is the exchange mechanism with USDT, every minute millions of new LUNA being minted which further and further dilutes the price

They made it so that they are interchangeable, so you can trade 1 LUNA for 1 UST, and vice versa.

This made it so that people could basically print profits no matter what:

- Oh LUNA is $50? Okay, I’ll buy a shit ton of UST for $1 and trade it for a LUNA, sell, and repeat. Profit.

- Oh LUNA is $0.05? Okay, I’ll buy a shit ton of LUNA and trade it for UST at whatever price it is ($1+), sell, and repeat. Profit.

Now, to me, this seems like an unfixable problem and the only way it can be fixed is if they are both priced at $1, but even then the small changes will cause a massive ripple effect because everyone is doing the same thing.

I keep trying to understand this stuff, but all I see is conspiracy theories, some about the KuWon guy, some about Blackrock and whatever other company, some about a massive plan to rug pull, etc.

So what actually is going on?

Can LUNA ever recover?

I can’t see it recovering as long as UST is interchangeable with LUNA, right? Because the prices will always be screwed unless they are both $1.

looking into the Terra / Luna / UST ecosystem and I perceive some clear risks to the overall ecosystem in the current setup. The following risks seem unlikely, but the chance of them happening is above 0, thus can\'t be ignored. This includes a possible total loss of funds for Luna / UST holders.\n\nHere are some risks I perceive and I welcome inputs:\n\n**1. UST market cap vs Luna market cap ratio as a risk metric for UST holders**\n\nAs UST market cap increases, Luna\'s market cap should also go up as more Luna is burned = less Luna = price of Luna goes up. However, a flash crash on Luna (due to market conditions or otherwise) can lead to a scenario where Luna\'s market cap is LOWER than UST in circulation, especially if UST market cap increases exponentially. At that point the question is, what is backing the extra UST?\n\n* UST Market Cap today - $10.5 bil\n* Luna Market Cap today - $28 bil\n\nAs of today, if Luna crashes more than 65% or to around $29, then Luna\'s market cap will be under $10.5 bil UST in circulation. What happens then? The UST/USD peg is lost. This is exactly what happened on 23 May 2021. 1.6 bil Luna backed 2 bil UST. The peg was restored after interventions, i.e. someone (hint: Terraform Labs) bought Luna to increase its price and market cap back above UST market cap.\n\n[23 May 2021 - UST depeg event](https://preview.redd.it/a48ycpmkhab81.png?width=2545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11aa903b017f08023bb0dd2481d5098868d74073)\n\nCan this happen again, yes. The problem is that as the UST/Luna market cap increases, we can end up with a situation where if the ratio goes negative again, it won\'t be $400 mil that are backed by nothing, but billions. At that point, panic will be quite high. What can stop this? A few billion buy orders on Luna from Terraform Labs to restore the balance. Regardless, this remains a risk in my opinion.\n\nIf you hold Luna or UST, watching this ratio is crucial, since if it ends up flipping negative, you better get out before or wait for the peg to be restored after, provided Luna does not crash to 0. Either way, anyone that used leverage to borrow against UST may be liquidated before they can react like in May.\n\n**2. Anchor Protocol - deposit interest crashes from 20% due to lack of yield reserves**\n\nA lot of UST was created and is used to farm the 20% interest paid by Anchor for deposits. Anchor represents 50% or $9 bil of the total value locked on the Terra chain today which is basically leading the adoption of UST.\n\n[20&amp;#37; interest on Anchor](https://preview.redd.it/l6x78xq5iab81.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7637e7a2fecf53474a70ec2f51ee30d53650508a)\n\nRight now Anchor has $60 mil in its yield reserves to guarantee the 20% interest on deposits. This is falling quite quickly as shown below.\n\n[Anchor Yield Reserve - something has changed after steady growth](https://preview.redd.it/whm7g9fh0ab81.png?width=1270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8d3c56f58058e3515bc7e1b8493689454756437)\n\nWhy is the yield reserve crashing? Because there are more deposits getting interest vs borrowers paying it. Worse yet, Abracadabra and other protocols farm this 20% yield and compound UST deposits to drain it faster!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Anchor deposit vs borrow](https://preview.redd.it/63vzko6whab81.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8afd2ab6bdc6f70d806f1ed5054b0c2c5306b57e)\n\nSo where is the risk? As soon as the 20% interest cannot be paid anymore, the interest % will be reduced to whatever is sustainable. However, suddenly, the 5.5 bil UST on Anchor deposits may want to leave Terra ecosystem to find better opportunities. What happens when UST market cap is reduced? More Luna is released into circulation. Luna price goes down, people that borrowed UST with Luna get liquidated. The whole process is reversed. What goes up, now goes down. Can this trigger a systemic risk as indicated under point 1? Possibly.\n\nWhat can save this? Terraform Labs injects fresh capital into the Anchor yield reserve (sounds familiar?). They did it before in July 2021.\n\n[Fresh capital from TFL](https://preview.redd.it/esfyzjh1iab81.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc23390c06f11569a2752ca9c0ec423cbebd439)\n\nBut this will only make things worse long term because as the Terra ecosystem grows on ""credit"" the systemic risk also increases as we\'re now talking billions not millions. So when the music stops, who will back the yield? No one and people rush to liquidate their UST/Luna.\n\n[UST Market Cap](https://preview.redd.it/xis5cpskiab81.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=160c50fc68523d2ae77318783fe65c9d29a930cb)\n\nObviously this can also be a slow process with the interest % falling lower over time and finding a balance. Plus there are capital controls so you can\'t really mint/burn UST 1 bil / day. But, everything is done to POSTPONE the market from finding an equilibrium between deposits/borrowers and when the rug is pulled, it may get ugly, fast. The peg can be lost again, people get liquidated, billions are lost. Who will buy Luna then if they risk losing their money?\n\n**3. Luna price goes to near 0.**\n\nThis is highly unlikely, but would basically make UST worthless and the whole ecosystem crashes. Likely it would not recover. While this risk is low, it can\'t be excluded can it? There is nothing else backing UST but Luna. What backs Luna? Trust in the Terra ecosystem?\n\nThe risk to me is the fact that at KEY points when UST lost its peg, Terraform Labs stepped in as a ""lender/buyer of last resort"". For example when the peg was lost in May 2021, Terraform Labs bought Luna, increasing its price/market cap. When Anchor was in trouble to pay the 20% interest Terraform Labs toped it off with $70 mil. At one point they will not be able to ""control"" the market from finding an equilibrium. Particularly if the ecosystem grows beyond their means of controlling divergences. That is when the crash takes place. Can they control it then?\n\nAnyone trying to control prices or the market will eventually fail. This is demonstrated by 5,000 years of recorded history. The more you distort prices artificially, the larger the eventual ""correction"". It would be best if Anchor finds a fair interest rate for its depositors rather than ""crediting"" it to keep it at 20%. At one point the money will run out and it will be painful to find equilibrium then.\n\n**4. Yield vampires - a risk created by the artificially high 20% interest on Anchor**\n\nAs indicated under point 2, the 20% interest paid by Anchor to depositors has led to other protocols (call them ""vampires"") dumping a lot of UST into Anchor to farm the yield and suck the money out of Anchor\'s yield reserve as fast as possible. This is done by creating more UST and compounding it several time with leverage.\n\n[Borrowing against UST... to deposit more UST in Anchor!](https://preview.redd.it/3v59dotkjab81.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=452034b71905d166b0b2c464b58c0837930730ea)\n\nBasically, market participants are doing a form of arbitrage here, whereby they will milk this free cash dry until there is none left and move on to the next opportunity. How long can Anchor/Terraform Labs allow this before it is a risk to them? The market will always seek equilibrium and this 20% interest is an artificial distortion, it will not last!\n\nWhy is it allowed to continue? It boosts the UST supply and ""adoption"", Luna price goes up... But it comes at a price, obviously. The hope is that Anchor can onboard more borrowers with attractive payouts (borrow and receive money!) to cover for the deposits, but this is misleading as the vampires will only increase, usually faster and liquidate the yield reserve. Anchor and the Terraform Labs appear to ""buy"" time (literally) and hope that after x amount of time, everything will be ok = market finds equilibrium.\n\nWhat if that does not happen and the music suddenly stops with your pants down? The longer they distort the market the worse it gets. Perhaps demand to borrow an additional $10 bil in the current market is simply not there... Anchor is encouraging people to borrow by giving them handouts! In any case, my point is, the crash will get worse the longer this goes, triggering other systemic risks as indicated above.\n\n\\---\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nTerra / Luna / UST growth is subsidized by incentives. As soon as these stop or are reduced for various reasons the growth we\'ve seen can be reversed, both in scale and speed as indicated by the underlying protocol. When this happens, the resilience of the system is put at risk and could uncover potential risks that are not so obvious during a bullish market. When taking that into account, owning UST as a ""stablecoin"" becomes much more risky than it initially appears. This risk is compounded as Terra ecosystem grows due to said ""incentives"". The crash will be harder when they stop.\n\nNevertheless, UST/Luna ecosystem has a sound mechanism to maintain the peg, despite any turbulences. Holders of UST should expect UST to lose its peg in the future again (this appears likely) and only if Luna crashes to near 0 (which is unlikely), would UST holder lose all their money. Those borrowing against UST would most likely be liquidated at some point in the future during a depeg event, even if brief.\n\nIn this context, would you hold UST?\n\nNFA / DYOR.

https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3

https://medium.com/ginsbergonomics/the-entire-crypto-market-is-built-on-fraud-deceit-d29c687891d9

And made this post asking this community how much BTCs value would drop if Tether crashes 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/unm3tp/what_is_the_consensus_about_tether_here/

And with the general market forces of the stock market in general in a very strong down spiral, mixed with what happened with Terra/Luna, mixed with Tether extremely likely being super inflated running on fumes, I decided to keep an eye on Tether right now 

And I first commented to others in other threads ""it's already down 0.6 %, which 0.6% of 81 billion is 486 million, which this inflated to the tits house of cards likely doesn't have the liquidity to cover, as if they did it wouldn't be dropping, and they already likely have been trying to douse this fire all day, and the current -0.81% is the net result of likely all the behind the scenes fire dousing ...

So I really think Tether is crashing today and by extension BTC and/or the entire crypto eco system will really bottom hard today ...

I am not intending for this to be a told you so moment, I simply implore people to be cautious in this space as it is highly volatile and speculative and it is hyper sensitive to factors outside your control (I.e the terra meltdown).

It is clear that terra will not recover and people are waking up to the fact the promised returns on stablecoins May be made of unicorn dust rather than any real world asset. Trust is broken, it is irrepairable. Nobody will look at stablecoins the same way again.

This is extremely concerning for tether and other major stablecoins. Unfortunately the flow on effect of this is that governments will accelerate regulation of this space, specifically stablecoins. In my opinion this is a really good thing, with regulation stablecoins will be forced to reveal their assets and comply, this will bring confidence back into the space and money as a result. Institutional investors won't touch crypto for a long time until these risks are resolved.

I understand we are anti regulation here, but let's be realistic. The authorities are not going to turn a blind eye with what happened with Tether. They have their catalyst and they will go in hard. Regulation is now all but inevitable.

We may crash much further short term, for example tether could be forced to disclose it's assets when government regulation kicks in. It could turn out it's backed by fairy dust causing a catastrophic free fall. We of course don't know but the risk is there.

Tl;Dr - regulation of stablecoins will be a good thing (and will happen whether you like it or not) because it will boost confidence that the Luna debacle will never happen again.

But my firm belief is this. If you stick to DCA in the right coins, don't over invest and look to the long term we are going to make big gains long term. Its hard to see right now especially with the risk of further falls short term, but historical graphs show we will inevitably bounce back.

Quick thoughts on the market.

BTC has been printing a Head and Shoulders pattern since the last time we visited this area. It just hit the $27,500 level of the Right Shoulder... If that trendline breaks below $26K we could see some serious downside. Ideally we see at least a relief bounce, with some helpful news and economic support. Anything above $33,500 invalidates this and we have a nice V bottom recovery.

If we break down below the green shaded area, we could see a market breakdown unlike anything we've experienced before. All previous patterns for BTC over the last 12 years would be out the window and we would be essentially starting from scratch.

For those not familiar, Head and Shoulders pattern is a very strong continuation pattern that has played out many times in BTC history.

Remember, it is a marathon, not a sprint...

As we all know, the Luna token is used to provide security for the Terra blockchain.

With the Luna price plummeting, the cost of attacking the blockchain reduces too.

Osmosis, one of the crowds most shilled Cosmos projects has a bunch of Luna tokens bridged over to it.
This creates a weak link due to the lack of shared security between Cosmos and Luna.

Think long and hard about security and whether you actually want a trustless crypto experience with robust security protecting your interoperability or if you want to play with protocols that have big variations in security where you can end up a victim through a chain you have little to do with falling over.

Shared security isn't really something you can ""bolt on"" to an existing chain that was never intended to have shared security - It's a full rebuild to do it correctly.

People inevitably end up learning the hard way although some do figure it out before they screw themselves over by backing projects with weak security. Some of course only learn when they lose money. Some never learn at all. Educate yourself technically on what you're buying and try to analyse the risks of various doomsday scenarios occurring before buying.

My question (since I didn't quite catch it from the article)

Is if Tether was found to be worthless (if it crashes like Luna/Terra did today) how bad would BTC crash?

How important is Tether remaining valued at 1 USD to BTCs value?

This tells me there's a very large a mount of incredibly stubborn (and in my opinion, smart) holders who aren't willing to part with their holdings at an extreme loss. Because frankly why sell at 97% down? 


Eventually UST will re-peg, and sure there will be a sell-off, but I think this is overalls going to ease fear and change the general sentiment of Luna, the people who really wanted out, likely already got out.

100,000 in UST in Anchor Earn

If you do nothing and it all goes to zero, then you lose all 100K.

Option B: LUNA trading at around $1 USD now but bouncing between 1-2 Move to Terra Station; Swap UST to LUNA; Assume it swaps at a px of 1.40; giving you about 70,000 LUNA; So you lose 30% and move on...normally you would lose much less but because the 1to1 parity is not there and there is large spread, you settle with the loss.

Option C: LUNA trading at around $1 USD now but bouncing between 1-2 Move to Terra Station; Swap UST to LUNA; Assume it swaps at a px of 1.40; giving you about 70,000 LUNA; But then you can move 70K LUNA to CDC for no fee. And if LUNA goes back up to just $2 USD, then you've doubled your position and it is $140K or a 40% return off your original 100K UST.

I've traded through multiple markets, and the crypto markets don't seem to have capitulated just yet. The key level in BTC to watch is $20K, and it wouldn't be crazy if it got there within the next week or two. If that $20K level can't hold, there may be massive selling down to $10K. A weak Bitcoin can cause the altcoins to drop, which they've been doing already.  


With Ethereum, that $1500 level is key, and with scalability issues still coming about and NFTs crashing — it can potentially get there.   


The shakeup in UST may cause more regulations for stablecoins, and that can damage the entire crypto market. There have been forced liquidations in the derivatives for Terra, and you can decide to buy the dip if you want, but I'm going to remain patient because I think we might be headed much lower.  


HODLing only works if you have a lot of cash and can continue to buy dips, but if you're all in - you might be in for a rude awakening. This is an actual bear market, and it could get worse for the next year or two.

The worry now is that it appears that exchanges can use your assets to pay off institutional investors before retail.

In the past 24 hours , 358,222 traders were liquidated, the total liquidations come in at $1.01 billion.

The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance - ETHUSDT value of $17.77M.

As we know shorts are not the only ones getting destroyed by using leverage and it's equally as dangerous to use leverage on long positions. 

Just in the last 24 hours, $940 million of longs was liquidated.

$600 million was wiped just from BTC, ETH and Terra.

I have recently seen so many Reddit stories of many Terra Luna Investors who lost a lot of their major funds due to Terra Luna’s crash.

Whether they were borrowing money or overly invested into one singular ecosystem, It’s unfortunate and sad to see, but this should be a lesson to anyone new. You should never invest what you can’t afford to lose.

Some people also invested money they couldn’t afford to lose throughout the 2017 bull market and bought Altcoins that still haven’t recovered, and the 2018-2019 bear market wiped them out clean for the most part.

I’m glad I didn’t have too much into Luna, I lost a bit buying Luna during its recent crash but I’m fine with that. It’s money that can be made back.

I don’t care what no one says, most to all didn’t expect Luna to crash this hard. Luna was just at All time highs last month and it’s now down 99%.

No, this is not a fire sale. Do not mistake this unfortunate crash as a ‘buy the dip moment’. 

As far as I’m concerned, the project is dead. The project and concept is proven to not be viable. There has always been an inherit risk that UST will lose its peg, as many skeptics have mentioned before. 

I urge you all to please stay away from this project, at least until it is reasonable to believe that there can be a comeback. 

There is a massive risk in buying these tokens or playing with leverage right now. 

Yes, I understand you could have bought at $1 this morning and sold at $4, but swing trading like that is extremely risky right now. This project could dip another 90% from here. This may not be the bottom.

We've all seen the article and I'll post a link below but heres my view. and yes I am COMPLETELY biased thinking this is a BIG BROTHER banking type move to make money.

The article
news. bitcoin .com/stablecoin-implosion-luna-and-ust-lose-significant-value-downturn-ripples-across-the-crypto-economy/


My thoughts:
Personally I thin it's a ploy to drive the drive extremely low while gaining massive popularity with this token. I think the ""devil is in the details"" of this article. It was said I think in the second paragraph.

""First, we endorse the community proposal 1164 to Increase basepool from 50M to 100M SDR *) Decrease PoolRecoveryBlock from 36 to 18 This will increase minting capacity from $293M to ~$1200M,” the Terra co-founder added.""

If course u want to mint more to sell more but the more u have minted without active investors per coin or share, then the total minted becomes worth-less. That is until ""the troubles"" are resolved and the price has room to increase.

As noted in the article, Keon and other major players at the top already have large reserves but at that point they had reserves of a limited supply of a commodity.

Business rule 101:
Create so.ething that everyone wants as long as u have control of its value. If you cant co trolls the value, then create an intrest.
If you cant create intrest, then scare the ppl who own it into thinking itll be worth more.
But if everyone already has one, then you'll need to create more to gain more investors because ur current investors are maxed out.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4827312,public,self,$Luna down.

Right now it is important to defend the integrity of authentic projects and be stay positive.
