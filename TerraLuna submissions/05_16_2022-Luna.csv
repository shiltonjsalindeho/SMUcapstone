Many had quite a bull run in 2021 and basically all of them are now substantially down.

Since the demise of Luna and the relatively low prices of the other L1s, that look like a very good investment opportunity at the moment (although I am waiting for a bit more bottom probably….), which chain do you believe will perform the best from here? 

Personally, I am into interoperability plays (some call them L0) such as ATOM and DOT, which I see very promising. 

I am also into AVAX, SOL (I know many in this sub hate it) and NEAR, while I recently exited from FTM: too much DeFi dependent, and with the Luna story I believe TVL-driven chains which offer mainly farming incentives will have problems of trust and sustainability. I also exited ONE, once one of my absolute favourites, since disagreeing with some recent choices that have been done within the ecosystem (and I believe it is too much DFK dependent).

I am eyeing ADA a lot, particularly at this low price. Also I am a longtime fan of ALGO but not fully convinced by tokenomics and institutional focus (I have difficulty in seeing how some of these initiatives like CBDCs and green certificates can translate into retail benefit/price action), even if I believe it has one of the best tech out there. Finally, I am also following EGLD, there are a lot of similiarities with NEAR and it would not make much sense in terms of diversification.

Recap: currently I am in AVAX, SOL, NEAR, DOT, ATOM

Considering: ADA

Undecided: ALGO, EGLD (pls help me changing idea if you have interesting inputs / points of view, particularly if you have an opinion in the NEAR vs. EGLD dilemma) :)",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4861246,public,,self,Current downturn - Which L1s have the highest potential (and trust),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uq8vtz/current_downturn_which_l1s_have_the_highest/,,all_ads,6,1652600976.0,,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somewhat deeper, you get the preachy ones, including those who hate common people entering crypto because how dare the peasants try and escape their three jobs and crippling debt by taking a shortcut? This group tends to include wealthier individuals, and people with at least some experience in investments and trading.

Finally, you have the compassionate ones, those that correctly see that our economies are so broken that these scammy projects are becoming many people's hail Mary attempts to escape mounting medical debt or increasing poverty: this analysis seems to be more common in progressive/leftist circles.

About ten days ago, [Liz Warren was getting blasted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uj4z6g/elizabeth_warrens_obsession_with_crypto_continues/) on every crypto sub for saying, "" **Investing in cryptocurrencies is a risky and speculative gamble""** and suggesting that perhaps we don't allow people to idiotically allow their life savings into risky projects .  Projects that could go to zero in a short period of time - you know, like how about 2 days?

Enter the Luna/Terra disaster.  And here I am thinking, maybe... just maybe... this woman who taught commercial and bankruptcy law classes at UPenn and Harvard might be on to something.  She is, by the way, a consistent fighter on behalf of the poor and middle class.  

But instead of her, we idolize guys like Elon who manipulate his fanboys for personal profit on a regular basis while sitting on billions and billions of dollars, avoiding taxes the whole way, and offering to fix global hunger with his money - but doesn't - and instead does shit like buying Twitter.  Which, as an aside, is [just a money-making scheme wherein he takes the company private only to pump it and dump it on the public idiots via IPO.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-plans-to-take-twitter-public-again-later-sources-say-11651609707)

And honestly, I am so fucking sick of the idiotic, skin-deep ""thinking"" of crypto libertarians.  

I get it.  You hate the government.  And taxes.  And helping people who aren't related to you.  Because you just bootstrapped yourself up with ZERO help from anyone, right??  For example:

1. You didn't attend school to learn anything via taxpayer dollars.  You're entirely self taught.
2. You built your own roads and use your own electrical and water infrastructure.
3. You don't use any of the safety net programs like unemployment, preferring to starve to fucking death in your cold, dark underpass where you live whilst unemployed.
4. You definitely aren't taking government insurance help or Medicare as an old person, preferring to be left to the whims of our for-profit health care system that will *definitely* use market forces to drive down costs, not just ask you to pay all your money for [lifesaving healthcare](https://healthcostinstitute.org/emergency-room/ouch-new-data-reveals-er-spending-increased-by-52-from-2012-2019-with-patient-out-of-pocket-payments-increasing-by-88).

Ok, sarcastic rant over.  Let me make my actual point clear here:

I understand that not everything Liz Warren says about crypto is accurate, but we need to get people like her on board and helping make this work.  Crypto has the chance to free people from many of the same people that she views as the enemy: 

* Big banks that charge exorbitant fees for sending money, changing currencies, etc.
* Investment houses and brokerages that manipulate our markets
* Corporations like Visa and Mastercard that make huge % on every purchase 
* Insurance companies that spend billions of dollars on advertising to get us to buy their shitty projects that might help, but maybe not
* Fraudsters that sell fake products 

Crypto has the chance to democratize so many things about our financial systems, taking the power away from profit-driven corporations that will just milk it, bankrupt it, and start it over.   But we aren't going to get there by fighting the government (wherever you may be), dodging our fair share of taxes, and leading people into a wild-west shit show of scammers, insane fees (looking at you, eth), and utter confusion and chaos. 

**We need to help guide the regulation, maturation, and mainstream integration of crypto.**  And people like Liz Warren, Bernie Sanders, and other progressives are the right people to help do it.  YES, we need to convince them of the validity of the concept.  YES, they are partially just advocating for dollar hegemony because it benefits the USA and gives us incredibly leverage over the rest of the world.

20-30% survival rate, and she’s still hanging in there. She’s eating well (so far), and smells like hell although we can’t bathe her properly aside from wet wipes because of her recently closed incisions. She can barely let out a faint meow, and we can’t even use regular kitty litter anymore—every morning we rip up some newspaper after cleaning her litter box.

Anyways, it gets more dark and graphic. Not sure if I could even post videos/images if I wanted to, if I ever even dared to share something like what she went through. Her vet went as far as to say it could be feline covid (tinfoil hat moment for him). Although this sounds like rambling nonsense and a possibly drunken, incoherent comparison of my cat Luma’s current recovery to Luna’s potentially imminent demise… I have one thing to say.


Buy. At. Least. A. Little. Luna. JUST. In. CASE. (Not financial advice)

Anything can happen, not financial advice, especially coming from someone who just lost a $30,000 loan @ 25% APR without disposable income (see my post history) trying to long Algorand at .68 cents with a 4x margin.

If it goes to 0, it goes to 0, but I’m hearing from some who had Luna who bought a few million at .000006 and are sitting on a generous couple thousand as it’s ‘recovering’ to quadruple 0’s. If it can go $100+ to $0.000006 in a few days, anything can happen in the positive direction. 

Could it go to 0? Maybe. It might even go negative at this point.

Do I know this 20 year old Kwon guy or why people hate him so much? No.

Do I even know what the project entails? No.

Was I a long-time holder? No. But if I was I wouldn’t sell at a loss. I would buy the dip, like the imbecile that I am. Again, not financial advice. At this point though… it’s just whatever. 

Do I want people to not give up on something I know nothing about because I think they can turn this around for everyone and because I made a tiny profit and I am greedy? Yes.

Do I understand the UST mechanics? No, and I don’t care much for technicals either, as long as the project has a name for itself at this point.

Idk about you but I’m going to bet on the moon boys, we can be in this together. Life’s short so let’s do what we do best. Succeed or go broke trying. 

(Also, please no toxic comments about my cat Luma, you will seriously hurt our feelings, she’s less than a year old, thank you)

**Anything.Can.Happen**

**My condolences to those sitting on heavy debt/loss and trust me although I wasn’t in this Luna business earlier trust me I’m right there with you**

Is it possible that there are no other more convincing solutions on the Terra-Luna hard fork? No, because unfortunately the trust in the current DeFi ecosystem has been devastated. It will hardly be reconquered by now.

Therefore I propose to you a possible solution on what could possibly be done:

1) It would be more appropriate to bring together all the developers of good will and good faith who have worked for the entire Terra-Luna ecosystem in recent months, not just KUJIRA (for example: Astroport, TerraSwap, Reactor Money, RetroGrade, ApolloDAO, White Whale, Leap Wallet, Mars Protocol, Nebula Protocol etc.)

2) The future Chain could be based on GNOT Land for its functioning structure, so there could be the supervision of Jae Kwon and the developers exiting Terraform Labs

3) An improved and modified version of Tendermint could be introduced to have a much more distributed and decentralized network

4) CZ and Do Kwon could offer their help on the way

5) The Coin of the reference Chain could have a ""destructive"" Tokenomics as: 
- Automatic Burning Mechanism for Fees
- Biennial or court halving to make it more and more deflationary
- A model very inspired by that of Astroport, Curve and BNB in ​​terms of use case

5) In addition, a decentralized semi-algorithmic Stablecoin could also be introduced that takes the best of the best FRAX, MIM, USN, and Silk. Sort of like UST 3.0 without that big death spiral problem.


These would be my ideas about a hypothetical future Chain to preserve the entire Terra-Luna ecosystem.

 Luna is the perfect example for a hindsight bias, because it went down everyday an incredible amount pricewise and only had one pump after all, that not many guys had on screen. 

In fact, there was no logical explanation that you should put your money into something, that went down in freefall, because nobody knew what would happen the next hours and where the bottom would be. 

But why do people still think they missed out? Because obviously in crypto in general, people are loud-mouthed when they had luck for once, but all the mistakes around that one time of luck are never made public. So the ones feeling like it would have been easy to time that don’t see, how little the odds would have been to get that exactly right.

What I want to say with all that is that you shouldn’t be too hard on yourselves for not being the lucky few, when all you did most of the time was what sounded right with the information you had at that time.

On Friday, South Korean media outlet MoneyToday wrote an unidentified person broke into her apartment building, rang the doorbell to ask if Kwon was home, before leaving the premises after she said he wasn’t.

Kwon’s wife has now been provided with security after she requested emergency protection, police in Seoul’s Seongdong-gu district told Forkast.

The developments come amid a wipeout in the value of Luna, a coin that served to prop up and maintain TerraUST’s dollar peg.

Some investors who had owned Luna posted on Reddit that people were suicidal after losing everything.

Kwon, who developed a reputation for belittling and attacking critics of his project, has now been likened to Elizabeth Holmes, found guilty of fraud for her Theranos deception.

TerraUST was designed to trade at a one-to-one ratio to the greenback, but without some form of actual collateral that should underpin its value, as is the case with Tether.”

I've read TOO MANY post about people loosing all their savings on this shit and the world looks like feeling sad for them and to be hones I don't feel sad bout them at all.
How is it possible for an adult with a family, house and other responsibilities to just go and spend life savings on a fucking alt coin?  What the fuck were they thinking about?
If I see a 1 year old baby who touches the fire and hets hurt I would definitely feel sad in some way, but If I see a 30 year old man to just put his hand on the fire and get hurt, I will think he is a dummie.  The same happens here in my opinion. 
And people also thinking bout suicide... It is just insane.
Am I the only one who just don't feel sad about people loosing their savings on these coin? It is not that I wish them bad things, not at all, but I don't feel sorry neither.

But there is a ray of sunshine, some good in all this misery, a new way to say goodbye to your digital crypto baggage.

In this day and age, burning is widely known to be a factor in climate change.

We urge you therefor not to burn your LUNA, but to recycle them!

With the latest crash and obliteration of LUNA we urge people not to just let them lay around unused on their hard-disks, ledgers, phones or exchanges. Give them a new life!

In our dedicated sorting and recycling plant we take care of your discarded LUNA and will make sure their Blockchain components will get a new use!

We will sort all those bits and bytes into reusable 0 and 1. Maybe one day, a new coin will rise out of them?

The Blockchain world thanks you very much!

Lets end the cycle of burning together and move ahead into a sustainable future with recycling.

People just downvote the hack out of my posts. It's funny how people's views change with the trend. Ok, back to the main topic.

In that post I defended Tether and many people started to call me out for supporting Tether. It is hard to explain Tether in a comment. So, let's take a deep dive.

Tether claims in its [transparency page](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports) that it is fully backed. Of course they would. Here's what they claim (and there are lies in it, scroll down to know why):

[Tether Reserves May 2022](https://preview.redd.it/ocfbv2xaxkz81.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85acd8788b962bd47c7570e7bc7122a0469f71fe)

These numbers are from the last report which is from 31 Dec, 2021. They were supposed to publish another report on 31 Mar, 2022 which they didn't and the reason is because they aren't fully backed. You of course wouldn't want others to know that you don't have 100% of the backing. Even if they don't say, we can make an approximate calculation based on that few month old report. Let's do that.

""*Other investments*"" is a fancy way of saying cryptocurrencies. With the recent dump, the most pessimistic outlook would be that they have lost 50-70% or so of that 6.38% in ""*Other investments*"". That would mean they have about 3%\~ish in it. Assuming all other figures are accurate, Tether would then have a **reserve of 96.62%**. And the optimistic view would be a loss of like 30% which would mean a total reserve of **about 98%\~**.

Now, let's account for all the other stuff. *Secured Loans* are generally liquid. *Bonds and Metals* I believe are also covered. They might have made some more with the rise of gold prices. xD

In the *Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents* section, T-Bills and Bank Deposits are secured (best cash assets). The *Money Market Funds* is also a small portion hence I will take that at face value. The biggest issue is the 36.68% in this section which is 30.715% of the total reserve. Here's its breakdown:

 

https://preview.redd.it/4ciawvb8xkz81.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b9574d4b1687762de36467321eef45cf1462481

Tether has 11bn for both A1 and A2 graded papers. These are generally good and A1 graded papers almost never default. A2 and A3 are not that bad either. The Other graded ones are junk bonds. I wonder why the auditors didn't say what they are. Maybe that fat check they received had some conditions? So, that's 300m of trash which is like **0.5%** of total reserves. Even if we pessimistically assume that these are defaulted bonds, it wouldn't have much impact.

So my most pessimistic outlook for Tether is that it is **96% backed and most optimistic is 98%**. So, yes it is true that **Tether is not fully backed right now**, and it is probably between 96-98% backed. But that doesn't mean it is going to implode and go to zero like Luna.

Ok, but you might say that they are just lying about these numbers in the report published on 31 Dec, 2021. No, they are not lying and CFTC has verified that Tether has had fully backed reserves for 27% of days for 2 years and they are under active surveillance by the US authorities and CFTC.

[CFTC Orders Tether and Bitfinex to Pay Fines Totaling $42.5 Million](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21):

As found in the order, Tether held sufficient fiat reserves in its accounts to back USDT tether tokens in circulation for only **27.6% of the days in a 26-month sample time period from 2016 through 2018**.

The order also finds that, instead of holding all USDT token reserves in U.S. dollars as represented, Tether relied upon unregulated entities and certain third-parties to hold funds comprising the reserves; coming led reserve funds with Bitfinex’s operational and customer funds;

and held reserves in non-fiat financial products. The order further finds that Tether and Bitfinex’s combined assets included funds held by third-parties, including at least 29 arrangements that were not documented through any agreement or contract, and that Tether transferred Tether reserve funds to Bitfinex, including when Bitfinex needed help responding to a “liquidity crisis.”

What the above statement means is that the total reserve was oscillating below or above 100%. The fact that Tether was fined is a good thing. It verified how legit tether is and pushes them to stay legit.

**The above context assumes a normal market environment. But won't it just go to zero in a bank run (a very fast one) causing a massive Bitcoin crash?**

Lol, yes but no. If people want to sell 84bn, that money would have to go somewhere. And while most of it might be redeemed, a major portion would require a safe haven which will be Bitcoin. So, in the beginning BTC might crash 30% but it will go up 200% or more if a bank run within say a few days were to happen. And **94% of tether backing is in traditional assets**.

The traditional markets will definitely feel the pain as tether will be forced to sell 75 or so billion in trad assets which could cause a crisis in the traditional markets. The funny thing is, this is the reason why CFTC went after Tether. Its main job is to protect its wall street masters.

And at least since 2020, he has been doing it full time, as his main activity. This transition, from a job outside of trading to this exclusive dedication, he was able to make after becoming a profitable trader with consistency.   In this world, we might think that this experience is enough not to fall into too big losses. And in part, that is true. However, he was one of the thousands of people who lost money with the Terra project debacle. Although he did not invest in the LUNA token, he did have tens of thousands of dollars in his stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST).  In spite of everything, Luna decided to still 'print' more tokens by uncontrollably increasing the supply, as they could have instead repurchased their tokens with part of the fee for token burning existentially, as has been done at GMR or Minosis Token at BSC.  Via Twitter, he commented that he had lost 70% of the capital he held in UST, following the loss of the 1:1 parity between this currency and the US dollar. A parity that, in theory, he was not supposed to lose. After all, it is a ""stable"" currency. But the reality has been different.    The story of the Terra project, its stablecoin, its token and its bitcoin reserves has ended in the worst possible way: with billions of dollars in losses and a lot of people affected with devastating results. ImmortalCrypto's case was not among the worst. As he himself claims, this has been thanks to the experience and foresight he had taken.  ""The distrust that this has generated, what it will also generate is that many regulators will put the magnifying glass on the stable ones. Which is quite negative because it means huge regulations for 'crypto', which we always know do not come as a positive thing.

The act of dissolving just days before the collapse of UST suggests the intent to eliminate responsibility of the aftermath, which serves as evidence that he knew something was going to happen. On top of it all, Do Kwon's Terra foundation sent 52,189 Bitcoin to Gemini and 28,205 Bitcoin to Binance, which were intended to serve as reserves to prop up TerraUSD (UST). So what happened here? This looks like one big premeditated crime to steal 2 billion USD worth of Bitcoin by means of using Terra Luna and UST as the front.

-going against this subs belief usually makes you money in the short term

To wit, just having some kind of established policy of stopping the chain with an *a priori consensus* determined circuit breaker on, say, 10 percent UST drops would have been HUGE.

Not to mention the Terra foundation/whomever made the decision basically causing most of these issues by permitting absolutely gargantuan amounts of UST to be traded off the central mechanism - so now people could tank the price without going through the UST-LUNA wallet/station mechanism, which basically charged a 10% escalating fee (which would accrue to LUNA holders) when withdrawals of more than 100 million UST over a day were happening. That would slowly shut down at least the LUNA printing machine quickly AND incentivize LUNA holding at that time (since you're now getting an escalating fee from the bank runners).

Obviously the coup de grace was Do Kwon's ultimate purchase of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin *with UST* (so his conjured coin) permitted those who *he gave that UST to* to now have billions of dollars worth of UST in their possession. Which they then dumped in droves at the precisely right time.

Perhaps the smartest thing for him to have done (in hindsight, though if you make a fucking algo stable coin, this should be obvious) is to *raise outside VC cash* and then use that fiat to buy your BTC as a backstop of last resort, if he felt that was necessary.

With Luna hitting the trillion supply and being worth a fraction a penny it should shift it's focus to the memecoin with actual utility.

I initially thought of this as a joke but Luna is essentially what Shib wishes it was. Shib keeps promising utility and it's own chain, well guess what Luna already has a functioning chain with utility.

First step is change the logo to a dog in a space suit.

Second step is to create as many memes as possible.

Third step is to get Elon to ditch Doge for Luna as the new king of memecoins.

Anyways, Aperture had a bug in withdrawals so I only moved the 8k from Anchor to Binance. I realised it was too late to recover peg, so I did arbitrage w/Luna and I managed to turn it into 17k UST. Which at current price is worth 3k$ plus the 4K UST in Aperture (720$) it's 3,7k$.

So I had 12kUST worth 12k$ and now I have 21k UST worth 3,7k$. 

I would like to limit  losses to 5k$.I had 12k So I need to turn those 21k UST into 7k$. This would require UST to reach 0.3$.

Since Proposal 1164 was not implemented yet, do you think that setting a limit sell and wait for UST burning could work? I basically consider those 3,7k gone right now, so I would even consider the possibility of day trading, or of converting half of it to LUNA and see what happens. I'd rather have nothing than give up now and cash out 3,7k.

**My question is: as a US investor, where do you buy Bitcoin puts?**

Issues with existing solutions:

* Derebit basically owns the centralized options market (The Block: [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/options](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/crypto-markets/options), Skew: [https://analytics.skew.com/dashboard/bitcoin-options](https://analytics.skew.com/dashboard/bitcoin-options)). Unfortunately, they require you to KYC and prove that you are not a citizen or located in the US (Restricted Countries: [https://legacy.deribit.com/pages/information/Restricted\_Countries](https://legacy.deribit.com/pages/information/Restricted_Countries)), so a simple VPN won't get you access.
* I've used LedgerX (now known as ""FTX US Derivatives""), but I was unable to buy puts in size for a fair price due to the low liquidity. I think when I was buying my puts, the June 2022 ask for BTC was around $5, and the bid was $2.5. The same contracts on Derebit had a bid of around $3.6 and an ask of $3.8...a much more accurate reflection of market price.
* There are also a bunch of decentralized options exchanges ([https://jumpcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-derivatives-market/](https://jumpcrypto.com/state-of-crypto-derivatives-market/)), but they either don't have long dated puts or still require KYC+ban US residents/citizens.

A few solutions that cross my mind that I'm wondering if people do:

1. They happen to have dual citizenship and can just use Derebit
2. They use the CME options, since they seem to have 3.6x BTC open interest vs. LedgerX (according to skew today)
3. They use one of the decentralized options exchanges listed in the Jump post linked above and just roll their puts into the next contract as each one expires

IMHO, starting to feel it was one big Ponzi scheme that Terra team was wanting to ride along (instead of a rug pull much sooner) because LUNA just kept mooning.

Over the past week - team kept making assurances as if everything was alright so people could keep buying and holding, when they had a pretty good sense of they were royally screwed. Some of these assurances include:

1) ""Deploying more capital, stay tight lads""

2) ""LFG is coming to rescue"" (where did the BTC go?)

3) ""We are in war room and going to share a plan shortly"" (nothing meaningful came out)

....and many more.

In the hindsight, there seems to be very little reality behind any of these. The BTC reserves has vanished. Team is pushing for fork so they can have LUNA and LUNA 2 and can artificially create market to benefit themselves. Do Kwon said he has not sold any LUNA - hard to trust, he needs to provide the proof.

Their Blockchain was designed for attack and it happened and it got screwed. Thousands of people lost real money. Terra was warned several months ago - but Do Kwon seemed too arrogant to listen. See the tweet below and feel free to dig in on the twitter:

[\(Terra was warned of possibility of such attack in Nov 2021 but Do Kwon was too arrogant to listen\)](https://preview.redd.it/w4rrriadhiz81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a68017b7429b140808945023b58fea04e042d1)

All in all, way too many red-flag with the credibility of this team. They started with a grand and much needed vision - decentralized money for a decentralized world but it seems the greed and arrogance brought everything down.

Lots of lessons to learn. Hope there is a more honest team that can bring the vision of decentralized money/ algorithmic stable coin to life.

May the force be with all the brothers and sisters who lost life's money in this Ponzi project.

The SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission) has opened a case against Terra Luna.

&amp;#x200B;

​👮‍♀️ Singapore Police are investigating Do Kwon (Terra/Luna/UST) A police report has been published, according to which an application was submitted to Do Kwon from victims of a Ponzi scheme organized by Mr. Kwon.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post:

&amp;#x200B;

Do Kwon lied and misled investors by posting false information regarding a supposed $10 billion reserve:

&amp;#x200B;

\[The $10 Billion Lie\]([https://preview.redd.it/82ti5aoytfz81.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04a79d5c35eb6b118dcfb9e4c58914b150b24a0f](https://preview.redd.it/82ti5aoytfz81.png?width=1144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04a79d5c35eb6b118dcfb9e4c58914b150b24a0f))

&amp;#x200B;

He then lied to investors as the ponzi scheme began falling apart by reassuring them that capital injections were coming, a plan was in place, and when it was finally revealed, he referred to the UST as ""bad debt"":  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[Lies and delaying tactics during the collapse\]([https://preview.redd.it/nhsubcxdufz81.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a42c283f9f8c6beeda2ebf3c17c01f034b07b14](https://preview.redd.it/nhsubcxdufz81.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a42c283f9f8c6beeda2ebf3c17c01f034b07b14))

&amp;#x200B;

10 Days before the ponzi scheme collapsed, Do Kwon laughs and preens for a wannabee crypto starlet while saying it's entertaining watching companies fail:

&amp;#x200B;

He knew good and well UST and Luna would collapse because he had already tried this before with ""Basis Cash"" which similarly fell to zero:

&amp;#x200B;

Tens of thousands of people lost everything this past week while holding a supposedly ""stable"" coin, which was supposed to have a massive reserve war chest. As with all ponzi schemes, it turned out the collateral was far less than investors were lead to believe, and now on top of everything, Kwon himself is suggesting that the remaining funds be used to bail out existing token holders, of which himself and TFL are among the largest. He is effectively redirecting the majority of the remaining funds back into his own pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

In consultation with an attorney, and with Senator Warren's office, who is aiding in an upcoming FBI cybercrime investigation, I propose the community rally behind a class action lawsuit charging Kwon, TFL, the LFG, and Anchor affiliates with conspiracy to commit fraud. Financial crimes in crypto once occurred with very little consequence, but those days are over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even early crypto frauds did result in some degree of prosecution, as Mt. Gox's CEO learned the hard way:

&amp;#x200B;

CEO Karpelès was arrested in August 2015 by Japanese police and charged with fraud and embezzlement, and manipulating the Mt. Gox computer system to increase the balance in an account

&amp;#x200B;

On 14 March 2019, the Tokyo District Court found Karpelès guilty of falsifying data to inflate Mt. Gox's holdings by $33.5 million, for which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

In today's increasingly institutionalized crypto world, and given the scale of Kwon's ponzi scheme with loss estimates in the $10's of billions, Kwon is almost certainly going to prison. The only question is how much of the stolen funds can still be recovered from his personal holdings. As with Maddoff, considerable value was discovered in a variety of physical assets ranging from homes, to yachts, paintings, and offshore accounts. Kwon is likely hiding funds as we speak. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's time for the South Korean Financial Services Commission to declare an immediate receivership of TFL and all of Do Kwon's holdings. Victims of the ponzi scheme are encouraged to contact them directly and press for immediate action:

""Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (Gemini have just denied apprently on twitter… ). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.
When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA , was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christsake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.
Blackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out.""

I wasn’t going to have to work the 9 to 5 at long as my coins only did a 100x. It’s not asking much honestly. I deserve it. 

It all started 6 months ago. The bull run was just starting. Elon said DogeCoin was the future. I believed a “celebrity” and bought so much, but the price never moved and Elon didn’t help me make more money. 

Then I heard about Shib. Everyone told me it was going replace DogeCoin with smart congrats and NFTs. I worked lots of overtime, sold some DogeCoin at a loss to FOMO in. After a few months my investment was down 200%. 

Then I bought into Luna and never did my research on the network. But the network then went haywire. And my $100k is now worth $3. 

What I’m I doing wrong? This was supposed to be easy.

20-30% survival rate, and she’s still hanging in there. She’s eating well (so far), and smells like hell although we can’t bathe her properly aside from wet wipes because of her recently closed incisions. She can barely let out a faint meow, and we can’t even use regular kitty litter anymore—every morning we rip up some newspaper after cleaning her litter box.

Anyways, it gets more dark and graphic. Not sure if I could even post videos/images if I wanted to, if I ever even dared to share something like what she went through. Her vet went as far as to say it could be feline covid (tinfoil hat moment for him). Although this sounds like rambling nonsense and a possibly drunken, incoherent comparison of my cat Luma’s current recovery to Luna’s potentially imminent demise… I have one thing to say.


Buy. At. Least. A. Little. Luna. JUST. In. CASE. (Not financial advice)

Anything can happen, not financial advice, especially coming from someone who just lost a $30,000 loan @ 25% APR without disposable income (see my post history) trying to long Algorand at .68 cents with a 4x margin.

If it goes to 0, it goes to 0, but I’m hearing from some who had Luna who bought a few million at .000006 and are sitting on a generous couple thousand as it’s ‘recovering’ to quadruple 0’s. If it can go $100+ to $0.000006 in a few days, anything can happen in the positive direction. 

Could it go to 0? Maybe. It might even go negative at this point.

Do I know this 20 year old Kwon guy or why people hate him so much? No.

Do I even know what the project entails? No.

Was I a long-time holder? No. But if I was I wouldn’t sell at a loss. I would buy the dip, like the imbecile that I am. Again, not financial advice. At this point though… it’s just whatever. 

Do I want people to not give up on something I know nothing about because I think they can turn this around for everyone and because I made a tiny profit and I am greedy? Yes.

Do I understand the UST mechanics? No, and I don’t care much for technicals either, as long as the project has a name for itself at this point.

Idk about you but I’m going to bet on the moon boys, we can be in this together. Life’s short so let’s do what we do best. Succeed or go broke trying. 

(Also, please no toxic comments about my cat Luma, you will seriously hurt our feelings, she’s less than a year old, thank you)

**Anything.Can.Happen**

**My condolences to those sitting on heavy debt/loss and trust me although I wasn’t in this Luna business earlier trust me I’m right there with you**

There's nothing wrong with doing that, but it's important to understand what has happened to LUNA in the last week so you can set some realistic price expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

[LUNA Price vs Circulating Supply](https://preview.redd.it/pfdlhzzhuhz81.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a52ec16b85171a2b862fccc03e6eb13d8a7d64d9)

Here's a chart of the price of LUNA (grey) vs the Circulating Supply (blue). As you can see, in a week the supply of LUNA went from \~350 million LUNA to over 6.5 trillion LUNA. This is an increase of  1905997.48% in 1 week, and this massive inflation of the supply is a major reason why we see the price trading at some hundredths of a cent. 

I have seen some justifications that if LUNA can even get to $1 again, the gains would be massive. The problem is, if LUNA reaches $1 again, it will have achieved a total market cap of over $6.5 trillion which is over double the peak total crypto market cap during our bull run. Meanwhile, the market cap of LUNA at its' peak was \~$41 billion, and with the current supply, if it were to hit $41 billion again, the price would only be \~$0.0063, still less than a cent.

So if you're throwing some money at LUNA after seeing the 1000% gains we've seen in the last day, best of luck to you.

Today, I see Tron Chain has gone up 14.78% in TVL.

Once I go and check the protocols I see JustLend as the top protocol within the chain.

Within the protocol, I see that USDD (a stable coin) is providing 19.94%. Now, i understand that this is a lending protocol and therefore the people that are borrowing will ultimately pay for this interest. Given what has happened this week with the whole debacle of UST and Luna, I decided to take a read into its whitepaper.

[https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf](https://usdd.io/USDD-en.pdf)

Now, onto point 5 in this whitepaper:

""  Adjustment of short-term price fluctuation 

The USDD protocol runs on the TRON network, of which TRX is the native token and the most natural defense against USDD price fluctuations. The USDD protocol uses TRX as the base currency to price USDD. The USDD protocol maintains the market price of USDD around the target price regardless of market conditions using the following method: 

● When USDD's price &lt; 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USDD to 1USD worth of TRX in the protocol. When 1USDD = 0.9USD, an arbitrageur can buy 1USDD with 0.9USD in the external market and then swap 1USDD for 1USD worth of TRX in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USD worth of TRX in the external market at 1USD. In this way, the arbitrageur spends 0.9USD to get 1USD, and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USDD will be burned, and 1USD worth of TRX will be minted. As the supply of USDD decreases, USDD's price will increase, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD. 

● When USDD's price &gt; 1USD, users and arbitrageurs could swap 1USD worth of TRX to 1 USDD in the protocol. When 1USDD = 1.1USD, an arbitrageur can pay 1USD for TRX of the same value in the external market and then swap 1USD worth of TRX for 1USDD in the system. After that, the arbitrageur can sell 1USDD in the external market at 1.1USD. The arbitrageur spends 1USD to get 1.1USD and earns 0.1USD without taking any risks. As a result of the above arbitrage, 1USD worth of TRX will be burned, and 1USDD will be minted. As the supply of USDD rises, USDD's price will go down, to the point where there is no room for arbitrage and 1USDD re-equates to 1USD. ""

&amp;#x200B;

How is this different from Luna/UST? 

USDD has a market cap of 300M$ at this point.

Running a chain is very complex. Economics are complex. Human behavior is complex.

You are putting all this together, you need to code with the precision of chemistry to get a project that will stand.

Luna was yet another project trying a new code, offering a different approach. 

# The favor

The attack on Luna has done us a big favor.

It has stress tested it, and exposed the weaknesses, and Darwinized the project. 

And this has been happening to a lot of different projects since the beginning of crypto. Projects getting hack attempts, attacks, DDOS, trying to pry any weaknesses. And there's often a lot of money to incentivize those attacks. 

Some have survived a lot of attempts, and have shown more resilience. 

Those attacks are showing us which crypto projcets have weaknesses, and which projects have the teams able to find real solutions for those weaknesses.

# The ecosystem

The longer a project has been able to withstand the test of time, survived attacks, withstand bad actors trying to take funds or try to expose weaknesses, or withstand bear markets and big stress, the more established and strong the project is increasingly proving to be.

Luna has shown that weakness in a projects are still being actively exposed or exploited. 

The crypto ecosystem gives no quarters.  

There's still many projects that haven't been around long enough, or haven't been tested enough. And their time will come to either be Darwinized or prove their resilience. 

And then there are projects that are scams and haven't been around long enough to rug themselves yet.

""Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (Gemini have just denied apprently on twitter… ). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.
When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST.

Money is hard to make. People work their ass off for $14 an hour, flipping burgers, and cleaning garbage. If you're lucky, you go to school and get a good paying job where you can buy a property, take care of yourself and your family, and invest some.

These people thought they found an infinite free money hub. Who has ever heard of 20% interest outside of a ponzi scheme? 

It sucks but again, if you put all your money in a risky investment and it goes south, you are to blame. No one forced them. They made a conscious decision and had to accept the consequences. Who here hasn't done the same and felt like shit?

I’m looking for vastly underrated and undervalued projects on major blockchains during this bear market.  I feel compelled to bring it to everyone’s attention but this is only talking crypto around the water cooler, so please don’t kill me.  I’m merely pointing it out and my logic behind it.  (And I want credit if this takes off).  The coin could do nothing but I’m speculating.  When Shiba INU rocketed, it took off out of no-where.  The people who bought it when it had no attention became multi - millionaires.  I have identified a meme on Cardano (the first meme to launch on Cardano) after smart contracts.  Much like Shiba Inu was in the beginning, it is not on the radar and it’s at it’s lowest point after the drop.

The coin is Hosky Token and it’s on the Cardano blockchain.  My personal belief is that Cardano will eventually be the number 3 coin behind Bitcoin/Ethereum.  It’s the most decentralized layer one.  They have tons of DeFi projects launching, scaling solutions on the horizon, layer 2 solutions, and they have stable coin platforms launching, Djed, Ardana, that will undoubtedly siphon off a lot of the market cap from the Terra Luna crash.  Tons of Cardano will be locked up in DeFi in the future skyrocketing the price eventually, much like it did with Ethereum.  I’m more bullish on Cardano as it remained steady during the dip.  During the next bull run, Cardano will be primed to fly.  

Hosky is the first Meme to launch on Cardano.  It’s NFTs are actually popular in the Cardano community and they have an active Discord.  You can stake their NFTs along with Cardano in stake pools and earn Hosky.  It is the most popular meme coin on Cardano.  Half of the supply is being held in reserve and the speculation is that it will eventually be gifted to Charles Hoskinson when the project gains more notoriety (although nobody truly knows). Most importantly, the volume and market cap are very low, despite being a major Cardano project.  Less than one million market cap, less than $1000 daily volume.  Lower supply than Shiba.  No eyes on this project or Cardano at the moment.  It’s listed on the two major Cardano  Dexs (Minswap/Sundaeswap).  It’s not on a CEX yet.

I’m looking for vastly underrated and undervalued projects on major blockchains during this bear market.  I feel compelled to bring it to everyone’s attention but this is only talking crypto around the water cooler, so please don’t kill me.  I’m merely pointing it out and my logic behind it.  (And I want credit if this takes off).  The coin could do nothing but I’m speculating.  When Shiba INU rocketed, it took off out of no-where.  The people who bought it when it had no attention became multi - millionaires.  I have identified a meme on Cardano (the first meme to launch on Cardano) after smart contracts.  Much like Shiba Inu was in the beginning, it is not on the radar and it’s at it’s lowest point after the drop.

The coin is Hosky Token and it’s on the Cardano blockchain.  My personal belief is that Cardano will eventually be the number 3 coin behind Bitcoin/Ethereum.  It’s the most decentralized layer one.  They have tons of DeFi projects launching, scaling solutions on the horizon, layer 2 solutions, and they have stable coin platforms launching, Djed, Ardana, that will undoubtedly siphon off a lot of the market cap from the Terra Luna crash.  Tons of Cardano will be locked up in DeFi in the future skyrocketing the price eventually, much like it did with Ethereum.  I’m more bullish on Cardano as it remained steady during the dip.  During the next bull run, Cardano will be primed to fly.  

Hosky is the first Meme to launch on Cardano.  It’s NFTs are actually popular in the Cardano community and they have an active Discord.  You can stake their NFTs along with Cardano in stake pools and earn Hosky.  It is the most popular meme coin on Cardano.  Half of the supply is being held in reserve and the speculation is that it will eventually be gifted to Charles Hoskinson when the project gains more notoriety (although nobody truly knows). Most importantly, the volume and market cap are very low, despite being a major Cardano project.  Less than one million market cap, less than $1000 daily volume.  Lower supply than Shiba.  No eyes on this project or Cardano at the moment.  It’s listed on the two major Cardano  Dexs (Minswap/Sundaeswap).  It’s not on a CEX yet. This is a rare opportunity as any significant volume, main stream adoption of Cardano, or Cex listing could make this rocket.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion to get in at the bottom  as the Cardano meme economy is just getting started.

But why?

The number of LUNAs has increased from 340M one week ago to 6.5 trillions. Approx. 20,000 times more. 

Therefore the current LUNA price of 0.00035 USD is equivalent to 7 USD. 

However the current plan is that the current holders of LUNA will have 10% of the new LUNA according to the proposed Terra Revival Plan. 

Therefore, if you but LUNA at 0.00035 USD, you are valuing the Old LUNA at 70 USD that is the same it was one week ago. 

Remember that 6.5 trillions coins being 10% of the new LUNA iteration means that you are valuing the new LUNA chain at around 20 billion USD. 

I think that it’s overvaluing by a great margin. I wouldn’t consider to enter unless it’s valued at less 40 times less (0.000009 USD approx). Barely being a top100 coin

If si believe the new LUNA deserves to be a top50 then I would pay 0.00002 USD per LUNA

In particular, I am thinking to gradually reduce my exposition to pure DeFi cryptos and focus on more solid plays.

My portfolio is composed by: BTC, ETH, SOL, ATOM, DOT, MATIC, NEAR, FTM, RUNE, LUNA (RIP)

Going forward, I was thinking to focus my DCA on SOL, ATOM, DOT and MATIC (on top of the big 2 of course)

FTM and NEAR I am down 60%, I am not sure of the future of FTM at this point but I am too down to exit and I think it will rebound at least a bit, so I am waiting...while I strongly believe in the future of NEAR and USN structure looks not at risk of a death spiral like UST, although I feel a bit of cold feet now on NEAR. I really believe in it, particularly at these prices, but it’s like I don’t have balls to invest significantly more in it at this point. RUNE is a long term experiment in which I believe but I want to see how it unveils before increasing my exposition.

SOL, DOT, ATOM, MATIC, at today’s prices, look like great risk/reward plays. I am also seriously considering to enter in ADA, having observed its relative resilience compared to the other coins, but still a bit concerned by its massive market cap - what do you guys think?

People are quick to hate, demand justice, bring out the pitchforks when things go wrong.

But when Luna was making millionaires after millionares, no one complained once.

Now they are demanding justice, they are demanding refunds, they are demanding compensation for lost funds.

Guess what? You want decentralization, deregulation, far west rules in crypto when it benefits you. When you can fuck the banks. When you want anonimity. When you can do some tax avoidance.

But when something goes wrong, then ""who's going to take action against so and so?"" Or, ""why isn't the government/police/FBI/whatever doing something about this?""

Sorry, you cannot have both.

Also, it's not like he did a rug pull and fucked us all. Luna/UST entered a death spiral due to the intrinsic mechanisms that tie the two together. He's not sitting happily in a desert island thanks to all of your invested money.

The key similarities to me are the recent way top20 and even top10 projects have simply folded creating huge fear in the overall crypto market and much like in 2018 we are in a timeline of extreme FUD. There's war happening in Europe between Ukraine and Russia and the overall markets are in a big decline. Inflation is at an all time high.

These are all perfect conditions for creating a huge market crash like we had back in 2018 that went on for almost 2 years until the bull run started in 2021 (some argue we had a bull run in 2020).

If we look at some other similarities within our space you have the recent crash in LUNA.

Luna &amp; UST were  top 10 coins that left investors ruined when they both crashed. Seemingly there is some type of discussions within their community and attempts to save the projects.

Now I don't want to compare projects but here but...anyone else getting flashbacks to BitConnect crash in 2018? I'm not looking to smear campaign LUNA here, BitConnect was an obvious scam and a pyramide scheme. And LUNA still hosts a vibrant ecosystem of dApps. But fact remains both were top10 projects that crashed overnight.

Another good example I came to think about was Yearn Finance and Fantom. Yearns founder and Fantoms main developer Andre Cronje left the space leaving both projects in a free fall from their previous all time highs. Does this bring back memories to Litecoin founders exit during the height of the bull run in 2018?

I understand that Luna/UST facilitated a death spiral, and that it is different than how traditional token/blockchain dependency works. What I’m asking is, how is the current token to blockchain dependency any more efficient than token to stablecoin dependency? when the value of the token depends on an asset that depends on the token, a death spiral can occur.

That it is just a big random number which is unique and which people want to own and exchange for real money, just in the hope that in future someone will buy it from them at a higher price.

12 years ago Bitcoin originally actually set out to replace the dollar and other currencies across the entire world, because the fiat currencies were controlled by their govts, who could stop international transactions when they wanted just be denying citizens the right to purchase other fiat. It was a one-world one-currency vision of human beings being allowed to take financial decisions independent of their govts.

BTC was never meant to be an investment. It was meant to be a currency which could serve both as a Medium of Exchange (for all type of goods and services across the world) and a Store of Value (when you could store it for future use without it changing its original value), while also providing users both reliability of transactions, and privacy from govt and tax snooping. It wanted to circumvent banking delays and intermediary fees such as currency exchanging fees in fiat transaction.

However somewhere along the way, the idea was picked up and it got treated as an investment and not as a currency, It lost its currency trajectory and was hijacked into the investment orbit. This was followed by Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. et all. In fact all the crypto coins are not currencies at all in the original sense. 

The search for the real crypto currency is still on.

The LUNA attack was a planned attack on a well known weakness of the UST-LUNA algorithm that was designed only for upswing cycles, but more than the callous owner who risked the savings of millions of gullible investors, it was the whale which actually executed the attack who needs to be brought to book. The entire crypto ecosystem is characterised by non-accountability, lack of transparency, and no rules for the hit and run criminals. There are no system or standards of audit or disclosures of profitablity and ownership, other than PoS, of funding or business models, or of coins yet to be mined, or any culpabilty enforcement mechanism for investor protection. As the moderator in the Bankless podcast of the LUNA attack famously said, we are at the frontiers of the future and driving West. But all the more reason to carry life jackets, knives and oxygen cylinders like deep sea divers, or crash helmets, and radiation protection suits and communication systems like astronauts. It would be childish to explore the frontiers of the future wearing only slippers. 

 What is true for crypto coins is even more valid for DeFi. The basic difference between savings and investments is that savings do not shoot up or down because they are held in form of stable assets (property, gold, cash or bank deposits) where they are not expected to fetch high returns. Investments on the other hand, are expected to fetch returns and can move up or down depending on external factors.

Till the day DeFi is backed by a stable currency, it can never be used as a financial instrument for lending or borrowing, as long as more stable fiat alternatives exist. The unpleasant dichotomy is that as soon as a DeFi crypto coin becomes a medium of savings by becoming stable, it would no longer be seen as an investment. DeFi cryptos are currently torn between promoting themselves as transaction instruments or investments.

By 2023 we should be seeing at least 3-4 full fledged CBDCs on the market, Honk Kong HKMAs mBridge, Singapore MAS project, Nigeria's eNaira (already onstream), China's e-yuan, Russian e-rouble, Swedish e-Kroner and so on. The LUNA fiasco will only help the rapid deployment of the CBDCs. These projects are expected to incorporate in DeFi play from the beginning. backed by fiat currencies and soverign guarantees, with institutional control. These should be accepted readily by banks and FIs , being well equipped to become the true drivers of future finance. Sadly, DeFi crypto coins poudly proclaimed as ""currencies of the future"" may become relics of digital history in 2-3 years. The only ones to survive may be the ones that enter into development tie up with any major CBDC. These CBDC -crypto alliances are likely to survive for sometime more after which Defi play is expected to be monopolized by CBDCs only. 

The writing is on the wall.

It was resumed around 11:30 UTC with some protocol updates.

First of all, the built-in orderbook exchange was closed. You still use swaps like Terraswap or Astroport, but you can't make on-chain stop and limit orders. It doesn't change much but they decided to do it.

Secondly, they stopped the UST stabilisation mechanism. Before, you could burn 1 UST to get $1 worth of Luna, since 1 UST was worth less than $1, you could then use an exchange to sell it for more UST and repeat the process. This is what caused the inflation of LUNA, since this change the LUNA supply has stabilised around 6,530,000,000,000.

Now that the inflation has stopped, people have regained faith that LUNA can recover.  LUNA has already grown 10x since the resumal. It can't go back to $80 of course, but it still has a potential of about 5x.

Since arbitrage is now disincentivised, UST is no loner backed by anything. Despite that, UST has seen a spike of 4x. This is caused by investors buying it because of LUNA's growth. It doesn't mean it's going to repeg, once the investors realize, UST is going to repeat LUNA's faith.

All of this doesn't mean that LUNA is actually going to recover to its original market cap. The abandoning of UST has removed all differences between Terra and Cosmos from which it was forked.

1. **""Stable""coins -** Tether has missed it's 2022 Q1 reserves report: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uelepc/tether_has_missed_its_2022_q1_reserves_report/) In comparison: in 2007 a bank with $18B in dealings  (Lehman Bros.) took down the whole market. Tether is ""worth"" about $70B. The UST desaster gave a little preview of what can happen to USDT.
2. **19.5% APY -** If it sounds too good to be true, it most likely isn't true. Pressure on prices gets a lot of projects into big trouble. People are still waiting to cash out, since a lot of money is locked. The death of UST / LUNA made people question their investments. The CRO desaster did its part, too - credibility was lost.
3. **Escalating war in Europe -** Russian state TV is already talking about tactics for invading Baltic states: [news](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17965158/russian-state-tv-discusses-invasion-seizing-baltic-states/) / Russia's Duma parliament is making poland the next target: [link](https://www.latestly.com/socially/world/just-in-russias-state-duma-deputy-proposed-to-put-poland-next-in-line-for-latest-tweet-by-disclose-tv-3704154.html)
4. **European Union is considering a PoW prohibition -** Behind closed doors, EU officials talk about banning Bitcoin: [netzpolitik.org](https://netzpolitik.org/2022/climate-measures-behind-closed-doors-eu-officials-talk-about-banning-bitcoin/). Could be bad for PoW, but even PoS-coins would follow the market as usual.
5. **NFT market has already surpassed its climax -** NFT owners are getting nervous: [market report](https://nonfungible.com/news/corporate/nft-market-report-q1-2022) People are offering 30k for an NFT that once was 1.5M: [first tweet](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x28009881f0ffe85c90725b8b02be55773647c64a/20/)  
The rising market for NFTs is what fuled the rally of several coins. If the NFT market is losing marketcap, related coins will lose value, too.
6. **Inflation and possible recession -** If you think Bitcoin is immune to inflation - inflation means people have less money to invest, since expenses grow faster than income. We all know crypto is young and never experienced something like this. We'll see.
7. **Mass adoption? El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy continues to lose steam after 8 months**  
The recent crash will lower the chances of mass adoption. A failure of the current (seemingly instable) regime in El Salvador could lead to the country leaving BTC for good:  [link](https://fortune.com/2022/04/27/el-salvador-bitcoin-strategy-chivo-losses/)
8. **Evergrande** \- Admit it, you forgot about evergrande. They still exist and it's still not over. Now that we're facing a recession (especially on housing markets), evergrande gets even more in danger: [Warning of debt blowoff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/sunac-fails-to-make-bond-interest-payment-evergrande-update).
9. **Michael Saylor** \- The CEO of Microstrategies is known as the father of all BTC maxis. He sounds crazier every week with tweets that sound like bible verses. A ticking time bomb since the price of BTC is under pressure, while MS holds 129,218 Bitcoin right now. Please note that Microstrategies is still a company dedicated to business inteligence, not an investment fund.
10. **Exchanges** are struggling because of the bear market - [Coinbase got into trouble](https://fortune.com/2022/05/11/coinbase-bankruptcy-crypto-assets-safe-private-key-earnings-stock/)  
This could easily become a self-forfilling prophecy, since people fear their investments could be lost in a bankrupcy.

I personally think it's a buying opportunity, even though it seems very risky. A lot of people in this sub think prices will drop further, but the majority is known for making false predictions. No financial advice though. My investment will just go on no matter what happens.
