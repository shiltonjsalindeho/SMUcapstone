Most people worried about how the new chain was going to operate, but the problem I see is, well, what will it be used for?

Previously, Terra Luna was used as the ""stablecoin chain"", and almost all of it's TVL came from UST. Now that UST is gone, what will people use Terra 2.0 for?

### Here is why you should not use Terra 2.0:
1) The lack of interest from new developers to migrate to Terra (especially after the events of Terra 1.x) will render the chain mostly useless, and very little opportunities for you as an investor to make any money.
2) LUNA has little to no usecase either. Just staking and paying for gas.
3) All the ecosystems have to start again. dApps will have to relaunch, tokens will have to be redeployed, etc. This will leave Terra 2.0 will dApps that are not being used, and will deincentivize developers to build, and investors to throw money at anything.
