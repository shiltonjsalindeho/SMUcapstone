It appears that UST/LUNA was attacked, but how did this happen? Well… maybe if you hadn't declared to the world how to precisely implode your coin and told billionaires to ""try it"", then maybe this wouldn't have happened LOL.

But here’s the interesting part… 

Immediately after LUNA's downfall, there was a [post](https://i.redd.it/f1rvti5wury81.jpg) claiming that Blackrock and Citadel had borrowed 100k BTC and exchanged 25k for UST which dried up most of its liquidity. After that, it's thought they threw the remaining 75k on the market, causing Luna to implode.

This was a pure profit play if a short was opened at the top. Do Kwon (CEO) (probably) fell for the 25k BTC trade bait and accidentally was responsible for his currency's fate.

To be more specific, 72,000$ worth of Luna reduced to less than a single cent. So far, I've burnt 600k Luna since Kwon's tweet of burn address. I also have been member of both LUNAtics (LUNA) and Scala (XLA) community for more than a year and a half.

Lets start with events surrounding Luna: We know that Kwon did everything possible to dump old Luna and create new one. He went against 92% of community, against countless experts such as CZ (Binance CEO) and ETH fork creator for instance. The [proposal 1623](https://station.terra.money/proposal/1623) succeeded with a lot of manipulation from Kwon and Luna 2 is guaranteed to come. Kwon's happy but everyone else isn't. People go so far as boycotting platforms that support Luna 2 and withdrawing their crypto from them to make a point. People want burn. I'm pro-burn as well.

Now, here's my suggestion to everyone that supports burn: Luna 2 will be a thing, whether we like it or not, but there's also [proposal 1861](https://station.terra.money/proposal/1861) for burn and if you think about it, creating completely new token and implementing burn mechanism for old one, those two proposals don't oppose each-other. Even more, they're means to prove a point. We could sit and debate all night which is better: burn or new chain, we won't reach a consensus, since Kwon stands by his idea strongly, we stand by ours. Why not make proposal 1861 possible as well? That way, we benefit by actually receiving what we want and Kwon benefits by avoiding the boycott. This is the only way to prove which side is wrong and which is right. Therefore, we still have a chance, nothing's lost here.

Now, I've mentioned Scala (XLA) as well and I want to say some things about it too. Future of the cryptocurrencies lies in privacy. Scala inherited privacy from Monero and refined it. 100% untrackable transactions, support for mobile mining and many more, but the most notable thing I've seen: Kwon abandoned the Luna token in its hard time. Comparatively, when XLA had similar hardships, Scala Devs worked without profit, losing their own money, but made sure coin would survive and they succeeded. The loyal community needs loyal Devs and vice versa and I know community wasn't the reason of Luna's failure, it was Kwon.

P.S. I'm staying positive about proposal 1861, I'm supporting both old LUNA and XLA. If proposal 1861 succeeds and gets implemented, I'll stay supporting both coins. If it doesn't get implemented, I'll forget LUNA existed in the first place and only support XLA from thereon. I suggest everyone to do the same. Vote for proposal 1861, search for other cryptos while proposal's still ticking as the means of alternative option. My personal suggestion is privacy coin Scala (XLA).

**The Last Pump**

Do kwon has lost the trust of the entire crypto community and the terra project was backed significantly by that trust. To claim that a **Terra 2.0** will fix all the problems of the previous failure is delusional. But human emotions and sentiments are some of the hardest things to understand. To say people will stay clear of the Terra ecosystem is still uncertain. It like how people have a hard time moving on when they have lost a significant person or thing in their lives.

*'The last breath'*  of this project will try to provide a false hope for the seemingly vulnerable. People who have lost too much, People looking for a quick score, and crypto enthusiasts in general who just want to believe. This pump will in no doubt be the final rug pull or one in a series of *fails* because it is diabolically in nature. People will see the false hope carried into the new projects as a means of recouping their initial losses - a resurrection of their dead portfolios. This false hope can not be under estimated because human sentiments and emotions as I stated earlier are had to understand. But I remain certain that it will come, whether it is a good thing for the entire community or not.

Look at his past statements and comments. Such an ignorant and arrogant brat. Someone needs to teach him the meaning of Credibility. It’s a shame that the whole community will lose some sort of credibility because of him. 

Every failed project would go to the last checkpoint and reset. It’s not that simple. Basically he is just setting himself for another failure.

The proposal expects every investor to get their LUNA airdropped. Right now the few big exchanges supporting the ""new"" LUNA are Binance and Houbi. Those users will definitely get it aridropped.

As much as I like it that they are trying to make some damage control and refund users which is essential as they really had no knowledge of their own incompetence and no transperany. I would be happy if they get some of their money back because they truely need it and hopefully it will be a happy ending to a lesson for them to not blindly give your life savings to anything.

The new LUNA will probably just be a very short-lived refund for those who had LUNA before. Afterward it will likely crash again. Even if they made some improvements as giving more supply to users less to their own foundation. The trust is simply broken and rightfully so. The handling of this situation has been everything else than transparent, Do Kwon even tried to scam users afterwards with a fake burn address tweet and afterwards calling to not send Luna on that address.

I really hope at this point that no one trusts LUNA until they do some fundamental changes, the first would be kicking out Do Kwon. LUNA had some real utility, you can't disagree on that because they had actually developers that were dedicated and they had nothing to with this fallout.",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4917803,public,self,Even with LUNA 2.0 nearing it's launch and gaining support from big exchanges.
