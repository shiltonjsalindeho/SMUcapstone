UST has bounced up to .91 cents which is great, but how will their stablecoin last throughout pullbacks? Yes they do have billions on billions in reserves to help with re-pegs currently, but theoretically, what happens after they run out of money? Do they take out collateralized loans ? Do they ask for more funds from Venture Capitalist firms? (Just some thoughts)…

Terra Labs has also sold all of their current Bitcoin holdings to help re-peg UST. Definitely something to look at, I had initially not taken the de-peg too serious at first, but a drop to .69 cents is concerning.

Some of the FUD I had seen over social media was hilarious though, people hopping the bridge on Luna saying it’s done for is absolutely hilarious. Calling it a Ponzi scheme is pure impulsivity and shows your lack of knowledge/ lack of emotional control in these markets.

One type of cryp­tocur­rency, a so-called sta­ble­coin, is meant to keep its value at $1. But on Mon­day, the third-big­gest sta­ble­coin, Ter­ra­USD, fell as low as 69 cents, caus­ing a flood of in­vestors to sell their hold­ings.

Sta­ble­coins get their name from their be­ing tied to the value of gov­ern­ment-is­sued cur­ren­cies, such as the dol­lar. These $1 pegs are usu­ally backed by Trea­surys, cash and other dol­lar debt that is eas­ily sold in times of mar­ket stress.

More than $18 bil­lion was in­vested in Ter­ra­USD as of this past week­end, mak­ing it the third-largest sta­ble­coin, ac­cord­ing to crypto data provider the Block. But un­like tra­di­tional sta­ble­coins, Ter­ra­USD is an al­go­rith­mic sta­ble­coin. These pseudo dol­lars aren’t nec­es­sar­ily backed by any as­sets at all, in­stead re­ly­ing on fi­nan­cial en­gi­neer­ing to main­tain their link to the dol­lar.

Such de­signs have been crit­i­cized by mar­ket ob­servers as risky be­cause they rely on traders to push the value back to $1 rather than hav­ing as­sets that con­tin­u­ously sup­port the price. If traders aren’t will­ing to buy them, coins can go into a so-called death spi­ral. Ter­ra­USD has mostly main­tained its dol­lar peg, but it has been bro­ken in bouts of heavy volatil­ity.

In Ter­ra­USD’s case, if its price falls be­low $1, traders can “burn” the coin—or per­ma­nently re­move it from cir­cu­la­tion—in ex­change for $1 worth of new units of an­other cryp­tocur­rency called Luna. That re­duces the sup­ply of Ter­ra­USD and raises its price. Con­versely, if Ter­ra­USD climbs above $1, traders can burn Luna and cre­ate new Ter­ra­USD. That in­creases sup­ply of the sta­ble­coin and low­ers its price back to­ward $1.

The break in the peg, which be­gan over the week­end, started with a se­ries of large with­drawals of Ter­ra­USD from An­chor Pro­to­col, a sort of de­cen­tral­ized bank for crypto in­vestors, said Ilan Solot, a part­ner at crypto hedge fund Tagus Cap­i­tal LLP. An­chor Pro­to­col—which is built on the tech­nol­ogy of the same Terra blockchain net­work that Ter­ra­USD is based on—had been a ma­jor fac­tor in the growth of the sta­ble­coin in re­cent months, by al­low­ing crypto in­vestors to earn re­turns of nearly 20% an­nu­ally by lend­ing out their Ter­ra­USD hold­ings.

In tan­dem with the big with­drawals, Ter­ra­USD was also be­ing sold for other sta­ble­coins backed by tra­di­tional as­sets through var­i­ous liq­uid­ity pools that con­tribute to the sta­bil­ity of the peg, as well as through cryp­tocur­rency ex­changes.

The dis­lo­ca­tion of Ter­ra­USD from its peg caused some traders to panic and sell. To re­in­state the peg, oth­ers be­gan sell­ing ether and buy­ing Ter­ra­USD, weigh­ing on the dol­lar value of the sec­ond-largest cryp­tocur­rency by mar­ket value. Some traders also sold bit­coin over the week­end in an­tic­i­pa­tion that the plat­form would need to sell its bit­coin re­serves to sup­port the peg, Mr. Solot said. Bit­coin fell 10% Mon­day to about $31,076 amid a broad sell­off in the crypto mar­kets.

Ter­ra­USD in Mon­day evening trad­ing was at about 80 cents, af­ter touch­ing the low of 69 cents ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to Coin­Mar­ket-Cap. Panic sell­ing also hit the re­lated Luna cryp­tocur­rency, which plunged 50% from Sun­day to Mon­day, wip­ing out more than $10 bil­lion of mar­ket value, Coin­Mar­ket­Cap data show.

The Luna Foun­da­tion Guard, a non­profit sup­port­ing Terra, said it voted to sup­port Ter­ra­USD by lend­ing $750 mil­lion of bit­coin to trad­ing firms to pro­tect the sta­ble­coin’s peg and lend­ing out an ad­di­tional 750 mil­lion in Ter­ra­USD to buy more bit­coin.

​Do Kwon, the South Ko­rean de­vel­oper be­hind Ter­ra­USD, co-founded the Luna Foun­da­tion Guard and said this year it would run a huge bit­coin re­serve fund that would spend heav­ily if needed to pro­tect the sta­ble­coin’s peg. His com­pany, Ter­raform Labs, has do­nated sev­eral bil­lions of dol­lars of crypto to the non­profit.

“De­ploy­ing more cap­i­tal—steady lads,” Mr. Kwon tweeted on Mon­day.

The sell­off might have stemmed from some­one or a group of peo­ple try­ing to break the peg, Mr. Solot of Tagus Cap­i­tal said. Re­gard­less of the cause, he doesn’t ex­pect Ter­ra­USD to re­turn to $1 im­me­di-ately since a queue of sell or­ders are still wait­ing to be pro­cessed.

“I don’t think this peg is go­ing to come back soon,” he said. “There’s so much [Ter­ra-USD] still to come out of the sys­tem, and that’s go­ing to con­tinue putting pres­sure on the peg.”",True,False,False,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,4819674,public,new,self,"Cryptocurrency TerraUSD Falls Below Fixed Value, Triggering Selloff [WSJ]",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/um88vn/cryptocurrency_terrausd_falls_below_fixed_value/,all_ads,6,1652121615.0,,dark,,,,,,,
