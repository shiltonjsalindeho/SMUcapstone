So what does this c#ck head do…….creates Luna 2.0. This is a regulators wet dream. 

To ALL of the exchanges out there who listed this token……you fucked up. 

Not only do the regulators have hard on for flogs like Do Kwon, but you are in there crosshairs even more now. Exchanges literally listed the exit pump token for Do Kwon’s initial ponzi. Utterly psychotic. Like how can they be so stupid.

Exchanges should have denied the listing of Luna 2.0. 

This is why we are so far away from full scale adoption. It’s bullshit like this and maybe it’s time for the regs to come in and clean this bullshit up.

- currently rank 4500 on coin marketcap, room to grow

- low marketcap and recently created

Allow me to do a deep scatological analysis on which one of the two might have more value (***tl;dr*** they are both shit)

# 1st ROUND:

* Buttcoin is a peer-to-peer butt, meaning that no central authority issues new butts or tracks butts.
* Luna 2.0 is all centralized in one man's arrogance, we call it the rug-to-rug protocol or the Do Kwon module.

**Winner**: Buttcoin. Yes, it's shit (just like Luna or new Luna) but at least it's decentralised shit.

# 2nd ROUND:

* On the one hand we have the new Luna, which is backed by the very same things that made the previous one a total failure.
* On the other hand we have Buttcoin, which is backed by 'comedy gold'.

**Winner**: Buttcoin. Because it is backed by something, and we all know laughter is something, especially if it's worth it's weight in gold.. albeit 'Comedy Gold' which is essentially worth nothing.. kind of like Luna (but with laughter)

# FINAL ROUND:

* Buttcoin is not actually a coin.. nor a token, and it's worth nothing because it doesn't exist (nor should it ever exist)
* Luna 2.0 you can buy and it has value (at least for the time being of course)
