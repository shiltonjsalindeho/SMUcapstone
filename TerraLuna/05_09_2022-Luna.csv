I've been trying to figure it out what happened over the last 24 hours through all the noise. And there has been an awful lot. I'm only minimally involved in TERRA as I don’t believe the peg works. The risk to destabilisation is much too high. It seems to convenient to be long term effective to me. 


So here is what I think has happened. Happy to be corrected and include additional details as more are discovered. But why has the value for LUNA plummeted at three times the rate of the other big coins. Near as I can tell...

Do Klown (DK) continued the stablecoin backing strategy by purchasing a stack more BTC. Either a major UST whale, or multiple smaller UST whales didn't like this and started closing their positions. 
Large withdrawals started on Anchor and left only $300m left in the liquidity pool before the BTC reserves will have to be used. And with BTC price dropping due the FED FUD, this increased selling pressure. 

This started a cascade against UST. Investors became concerned at the prospects of a UST depeg and this tanekd the price of the paired token LUNA. Many started swapping their UST for other stablecoins which further dropped LUNA price. Then Binance announced no fees on trades between stables which just increased fears that UST would soon depeg.

It's getting ugly out there.
Bitcoin is down over 8% this week and has fallen nearly 50% from last year's all-time-high. The situation isn't much better for Ethereum, down 5% over the week, while newer best-of-breed coins like Solana (SOL), Terra (LUNA), and Avalanche (AVAX) fell over 10% this week. Things haven't looked this bad in a while, and it's going to get worse before it gets better.

But don't be alarmed. Like the meme of the dog in a bowler hat sitting in a house on fire: This is fine.

Before getting into why things will be (mostly) fine, let's take a look at what's causing crypto to melt down in the first place.
The primary culprit is the global macroeconomy. Governments around the world are being walloped by inflation levels not seen in 40 years, and central banks are finally taking measures—like jacking interest rates and shrinking their balance sheets—to fix this. Unfortunately, this has meant taking away the cheap money punchbowl that has powered decades of surging stock and real estate prices.

The result has been a wipeout in both stocks and crypto (Bitcoin is more closely correlated with the Nasdaq than it's been in ages) and fear among investors. Meanwhile, other global events—from the war in Ukraine to new Covid lockdowns in China—are fueling further sell-offs and adding to the sense of unease. 
In these circumstances, is it any surprise people are flushing their Shiba Inu tokens? Many crypto enthusiasts, and Bitcoiners in particular, like to believe blockchains will supply an alternative financial reality when the world goes to hell, but it's clear that's not (yet) the case. Crypto is as prone to macroeconomic shocks as everything else.
Meanwhile, the crypto industry itself has become a bubble waiting to pop. Pick your example—from the glut of worthless Layer 1 chains to fly-by-night NFTs to Floyd Mayweather's latest pump-and-dump. There's a lot money being squandered in stupid ways. That's fine as long as there are enough ""greater fools"" out there to buy that garbage, but when the music stops, it's going to look a lot like the ICO fallout of 2018.
We might be at that stage again now. Paradoxically, though, the current carnage we're seeing should be cause for optimism.

Since the birth of Bitcoin, the crypto industry has been marked by spectacular booms followed by painful crashes. If history repeats itself—and I'm betting it will—the impending downturn will serve as a healthy cleanse and reboot for the industry.

That's what happened in 2013 when the price of Bitcoin brushed the once jaw-dropping figure of $1,200, only to plummet afterward. It took years to reach that level again, but in the interim, something remarkable happened: dedicated teams put their heads down and built a series of innovations that transformed the industry. By the time the next boom rolled around in 2016, crypto had gone from being just Bitcoin and a handful of altcoins like Litecoin and XRP to encompass smart contracts, utility tokens, and a multi-chain future.

A similar thing happened after the bust of 2018. When crypto came roaring back in 2021, the technology had changed profoundly. A series of stylish NFT platforms had eclipsed the primitive CryptoKitties of the previous boom, DAOs took off for real, and the entire plumbing of the industry had become far more sophisticated.

It's going to happen again. Just as in the past, the dilettantes and hustlers will move to some other shiny thing, while the real crypto believers will stick around to lay the groundwork for the next era of Web3.
It's hard to predict exactly what this next era will look like, but a good bet is that it will feature low gas fees, easy-to-use Layer 2 options, and NFTs moving to the core of the music and entertainment industries. It's a
fun future to imagine—provided you have the stomach to get through another Crypto Winter.

Just to share **my own story**, really - **nothing particularly interesting**. I've been reading this sub a lot (never posted) - **had a lot of fun** in doing so, learned a lot, so I just want to share something back in return.

I bought **altcoins** between 5th of December (BTC was \~50K then, it was the first major dip after the 69 rally) and untill the end of January. Started with **GRT**, then picked a little bit of **SOL, MATIC, DOT, LUNA, CKB.** Bought my GRT on Coinbase, then **switched to Binance** (and transferred my GRT to it). Binance is infinitely better than Coinbase - transaction fees, features, everything. If anybody is still using Coinbase, I strongly suggest to you to switch asap.

I decided to stick to alts - I thought that, crypto being a risky asset, there is no point in buying anything that doesn't have at least a chance to do a x10, at the bare minimum - meaning that SOL at 2.7K is more realistic than BTC at 690K (market cap etc.). Of course, BTC is less risky than SOL (or other alts) but it's still risky nevertheless, so no point in risking my capital for let's say 50% gain (might as well just buy a blue chip stock and wait for the 50% gain). Just my own perspective of course. 

**I planed to invest a lot** \- but (luckily for me) **decided to DCA down rather than going all in**. I did this for a few weeks (buying small amounts of my alts), then when **I was constantly losing money**, I decided to **put the DCA on hold** until there is a meaningful rally. After a few weeks (and no rally in sight), I **closed all my long positions** (at something like a 25% loss or so). Then I decided to ""**invert my DCA**"" by constantly averaging down in **short positions on futures**. Pretty much became a bear, but I still had plans to switch back to buying crypto in the long run (I had a plan of something like 20K BTC for price, or the next halving as time - whichever (price target / time target) comes first).

Then **the March rally happened**, and **I saw that shorting is not easy** \- if you are very aggressive you will get wiped out, if you are too conservative, you are not gaining a lot from the short. You can make 1000% from long on spot with 1:1 leverage, you can't make 1000% with short without leverage. And any amount of leverage can wipe you out. I wasn't wiped out, but I wasn't making any meaningful money either.

**Today** **I closed my shorts**, overall loss of 13.5% (so 25% loss from longs on spot, then some gain on shorts futures, net loss of 13.5%) - that's including all of the transaction fees, deposit, withdrawal fees etc. I picked to withdrawal to my debit card - which is 1% fee, could have picked wire transfer, but didn't want to wait for a couple of business days. I deposited with card as well. I **encountered no problems at all with withdrawal** from Binance - I had a bad feeling that I won't be able to do it easily during the current sell off. So kudos to them.

**I don't plan to buy crypto ever again**, though **I wish you all the best**, and I hope that you guys recover and have a huge BTC rally to 100K :) I hope that **my capitulation marks the bottom of the market** :))
