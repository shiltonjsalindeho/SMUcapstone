But, I cant sleep and I want to go with some humble prediction.

My reason are not based on one magic statement that i found in their white paper.

I don’t think, there is anything to understand. There is no big villain, Citadelle is not on a mission to destroy Luna.

I don’t think TerraLuna is Bitconnect either, it does look like a good project. It does have a team of dev, a working product, etc.

At the time im writting this message, Luna is down 95% from ATH, at about $5. So, it a long shot but i have seen it but, a lot of my favorite project were down rhat much in 2019, and they exploded again in 2021, because they are good project.

TerraLuna had a flash crash, and it wont be the only flash crash of a bear market. And not the only coin to be down 95%.

I do believe that until 2024, we will be in a declining market. But, I think the drop os done for now, BTC drop almost 15% in  1 week. I think the bleeding is done for now. A bear market is boring, it is not a flash panic.

Anyway, a little prediction here. I think that the US market will have a rally wednesday because inflation number will be better than expected. And I think the crypto market will be green tomorrow.

So here's what you can potentially do to avoid being in that situation:

\- Set up a strategy beforehand.

\- Learn your investment and the risks assosiated with a particular coin.

\- Take the time to map all of your assets and track them a few times a year. Google spreadsheet can be a good tool for that, so no need for some fancy app to get started in understanding your net worth.

\- Understand that altcoins, stablecoins, shitcoins, is just terminology. Anything can happen to any coin, at any time. Nobody knows what is the future of any given coin, ever. I've been working in a Forex industry (on the tech side) for many years and I've seen enough examples of this, with day traders.

\- Yes, you should diversify your portfolio (index funds, gold, stocks, bonds, you get it). Hedge some of your investments if possible. Save cash in a savings account (3x-6x monthly expenses) that will never be used for investments.

\- Deposit/buy ONLY what you are willing to lose, and don't go above that threshold. Yeah, even for buying the dip, as tempting as it gets, after maximizing your comfort threshold. You need to be able to sleep well at night in order to make good logical decisions.

\- Imagine that the coin is going to lose 90% in value. How would you feel? What's your recovery plan?
