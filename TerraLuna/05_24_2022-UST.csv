UST was an experiment and still is, even though people were treating it like more than that.

The entire core idea of Bitcoin and crypto is to take decision making out of the hands of corrupt people and give it to the algorithm. That’s why Bitcoin is trusted: there is no central authority, no central point of failure.

UST was not completely decentralized. The algorithm wasn’t ready to be left untouched and mistakes were made. By people.And you can argue that if the algorithm is made by people then it can never pe perfect, you could also say that’s why we have forks, it was never perfect — but algorithms are not meant to be perfect, they are meant to serve a specific purpose and that purpose was not clear enough in USTs case.

If you look at Thorchain, their algorithm stopped UST trading before anything could happen on their blockchain, way before exchanges stopped trading and delisted UST, way before Terra blockchain was halted. UST as a core concept is not broken, the algorithm was broken. We just have to figure out a way to make it work… Like Thorchain did in this specific example.

Bitcoin did not fail for over 10 years, even if some people don’t agree — it serves it’s original purpose. Some folks just wanted it another way and forked it. Now it’s Terras turn — the fork will happen and Terra Classic will still be around. There are too many people involved with many different ideas of how it should work. So much commitment on both sides.

There is never only one way forward, watching Terra Classic and Terra 2.0 will be like looking at two separate universes unfold, we are living such interesting times.

I asked his permission to post this. he's scared about getting sued, but he'll probably go to the government with what he knows anyways and hopes he'll get some sort of protection there. of course he's looking for a new role asap

jump mostly seems to make money from Robinhood, market making for various projects (which leads to deals), some trading, and some vc

Jump was very close to Do Kwon. at one point Jump was offering to help grow the terra ecosystem through various projects. as most jump investments go, they were providing market making, doing some dev work, doing some promotional work, etc

then May 2021 depeg happened. jump offered to help rescue terra. the bribe from do kown was 1 million LUNA per month for several years (not sure of the actual term, but can find out from friend if serious ask). Do Kwon agreed and jump went crazy started buying luna on all the exchanges. this was a great deal for jump as not only would they make money on the trade itself, 1 million luna per month could translate into X million USD per month for luna at price X for a long time. this is literally billions of USD for Jump manufactured out of thin air to keep Do Kwon's project going. he had no choice (otherwise luna would have failed then) so he agreed. plus as I said, it's made out of thin air.

jump accumulated a lot ust which it later resold for $1 or above. it also had a ton of luna coming in now. it started selling this luna to retail via the various exchange and then plowing this money back into buying locked luna at a discount. it also started trying to continue to expand ust adoption (to push the price of luna even higher and maybe double or triple their many billions). by suggesting solana and other chains to adopt it.

here's the rub though - many within jump (incl my friend) knew it was a ponzi. Jump didn't care. how could they turn down 3-5 billion or even potentially 10-15 billion?

if jump had done the right thing in May 21, knowing full well it was a ponzi, instead of propping it up, the damage would have been much smaller ($2 billion), 1/10th of the damage done this month. not to mention the devs, projects, and crypto users in general

they should be held accountable for this

&gt; In August of 2021, whitehat dev   
&gt;  
&gt;[@0xfr\_ (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/0xfr_)  
&gt;  
&gt;contacted Do Kwon about a serious bug involving Anchor's possible liquidator issues. He was dismissed for 'raging' and Do Kwon was 'pretty confident' that it would work (you can already tell what's about to happen) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In April this year, as per responsible disclosure,   
&gt;  
&gt;[@skgBanga](https://twitter.com/skgBanga)  
&gt;  
&gt;and   
&gt;  
&gt;[@0xfr\_](https://twitter.com/0xfr_)  
&gt;  
&gt;emailed the Anchor team, describing three issues in detail (one of which could potentially cause hugely unfair liquidations due to a major bug in the liquidation queue). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The Anchor team never replied. Did they ignore the email? Did they just not bother checking their inbox? Either way, during last week's meltdown, Anchor accrued $20.8m in bad debt at a direct cost to depositors. [https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt](https://github.com/throwaway0xfr/anchor-bad-debt)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I remember seeing a lot of reports in the Anchor Discord of people being liquidated for their entire collateral instead of just what they owed. This bug explains it. Carelessness led to people's money being unfairly snatched away (again) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In the grand scheme of things, $20.8m is not that much (especially when UST was shedding billions from its market cap), but this event lends to a certain culture &amp; environment that seem to be present at TFL. Despite being paid millions, they seem to be flippant at times.
